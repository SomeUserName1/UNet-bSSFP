Abstract

Balanced steady state free precession (balanced SSFP) has become increasingly popular for research and clinical applications, offering a very high signal-to-noise ratio and a T 2 /T 1 -weighted image contrast. This review article gives an overview on the basic principles of this fast imaging technique as well as possibilities for contrast modification. The first part focuses on the fundamental principles of balanced SSFP signal formation in the transient phase and in the steady state. In the second part, balanced SSFP imaging, contrast, and basic mechanisms for contrast modification are revisited and contemporary clinical applications are discussed. J. Magn. Reson.
