Triple Echo Steady-State (TESS) Relaxometry

Rahel Heule,1* Carl Ganter,2 and Oliver Bieri1

Purpose: Rapid imaging techniques have attracted increased interest for relaxometry, but none are perfect: they are prone to static (B0) and transmit (B1) field heterogeneities, and commonly biased by T2/T1. The purpose of this study is the development of a rapid T1 and T2 relaxometry method that is completely (T2) or partly (T1) bias-free. Methods: A new method is introduced to simultaneously quantify T1 and T2 within one single scan based on a triple echo steady-state (TESS) approach in combination with an iterative golden section search. TESS relaxometry is optimized and evaluated from simulations, in vitro studies, and in vivo experiments. Results: It is found that relaxometry with TESS is not biased by T2/T1, insensitive to B0 heterogeneities, and, surprisingly, that TESS-T2 is not affected by B1 field errors. Consequently, excellent correspondence between TESS and reference spin echo data is observed for T2 in vitro at 1.5 T and in vivo at 3 T. Conclusion: TESS offers rapid T1 and T2 quantification within one single scan, and in particular B1-insensitive T2 estimation. As a result, the new proposed method is of high interest for fast and reliable high-resolution T2 mapping, especially of the musculoskeletal system at high to ultra-high fields.

quantification requires longer scan time and the overall success and applicability of quantitative MRI methods in the clinical setting will depend greatly on the overall acquisition speed. As a result, SSFP-based imaging techniques have come into the research focus, e.g., for relaxation time mapping (3–10), for measuring molecular proton diffusion (11–15), for the assessment of magnetization transfer effects (16–18), or for the characterization of flow or motion (19–21).
Relaxation is one of the most fundamental fingerprints of NMR. It not only defines contrast in conventional MRI but also reflects the local interaction of water on a molecular and thus very fundamental level. Longitudinal relaxation (T1) is typically assessed from inversion recovery (IR) spin echo (SE) techniques, whereas transverse relaxation (T2) is commonly based on sampling the decay of the transverse magnetization using single-echo or multiecho SE methods. Acquiring the complete T1 recovery or T2 decay curve is time consuming and frequently requires segmented imaging strategies. In contrast, quantification techniques that make use of the

Since its introduction more than half a century ago, the use of steady-state free precession (SSFP) (1) has become increasingly popular, and a large number of SSFP imaging techniques has been described so far (e.g., see Handbook of MRI Pulse Sequences (2). Besides morphological imaging, SSFP has also attracted considerable interest for fast quantitative MRI. Quantitative imaging is thought to represent an important future step toward a significant improvement of the diagnostic potential of MRI, for the early detection of subtle or diffuse pathological changes with high specificity and sensitivity, for an unbiased assessment of treatment or drug effects, as well as for clinical trials in drug research across different sites. When compared with morphological imaging, however,

functional dependence of the steady state on its intrinsic and extrinsic parameters are considerably faster. A common feature of rapid SSFP sequences is their mixed T2/ T1 imaging contrast; a natural consequence of a pulse repetition time (TR) being much shorter than T2. As a result, accurate quantification of relaxation times using SSFP-based imaging techniques is hampered by a varying marginal T2-related bias in T1 estimates, as seen in radiofrequency spoiled SSFP (22), or by a more or less pronounced T1-related bias in T2, as seen in balanced SSFP (23), partially spoiled SSFP (10), and double echo SSFP (9). Moreover, all SSFP imaging techniques proposed so far, as well as multiecho SE techniques commonly used for T2 mapping, are highly sensitive to transmit field (B1) inhomogeneities that become especially prominent at high (3 T) to ultra-high (7 T and higher) field strength. As a result, without additional corrective data, accurate and thus fast and reliable quantification of relaxation times is not feasible in practice.
In summary, several different steady-state methods

have been proposed for relaxometry, but none are per-

fect: all of them are B1-sensitive, require multiple scans (except for the dual echo approach (9)), suffer from a T2/ T1 related bias, or are prone to static (B0) field inhomogeneities (24). Hence, there is much room for methodological improvement. In this work, we present a completely new approach for rapid quantification of both, T1 and T2 relaxation times, within one single scan using a triple echo steady-state (TESS) approach. Here, we make use of the different functional dependence of the two lowest order SSFP-FID modes (free induction decay) and of the lowest order SSFP-Echo mode, acquired within every TR, for rapid relaxometry using an iterative golden section search algorithm.

Triple Echo Steady State
Multiecho SSFP, as displayed in Figure 1a, was already proposed by Mizumoto and Yoshitome for imaging different contrast dependencies (25). Generally, the ideal SSFP signal (no motion, no diffusion, quasi-instantaneous radiofrequency pulses) can be written in a representation that is closely related to configuration theory (26). Expressions for the two lowest order modes (F0, representing the FID, and FÀ1 representing the Echo) immediately following the excitation pulse can be found, e.g., in (27),

Note that all modes Fn in Eq. [3] are positive by definition (in contrast to Eq. 21 given in Ref. 27, where the modes are negative for n < 0). Exemplary F1, F0, and FÀ1 steady-state signal levels for tissues and fluids are shown in Figure 1b,c as a function of the flip angle. Taking now into account that the signals are acquired with t > 0 (rather than t ¼ 0), the signal expressions become weighted by the corresponding echo time (TE1, TE0, and TEÀ1; for details, see Fig. 1a)

For short enough TEs, a T2 rather than a T2Ã weighting is introduced to Eqs. [1], [2], and [4]. As reported in (28),
the error arising from such an approximation is small.

Relaxometry With TESS
As proposed for rapid quantification of T2 from double echo steady state (DESS) (9), we follow the initial idea of exploiting the dependencies of the modes on relaxation to quantify T1 and T2. To this end, we investigate the following signal ratios (see Fig. 2):

culate an updated T2,iþ2 estimate based on Eq. [7], and so on. The iteration stops as soon as the change in both
T1 and T2 is less than a user defined convergence tolerance, i.e., 0.1 ms. While iterating, the whole search pro-
cedure becomes independent of the initial T1 estimate. In this work, we use a consistent rough global estimate of T1 ¼ 1000 ms for all simulations, as well as in vitro and in vivo relaxometry. Even with such a rough guess,
typically less than 10 iterations are required for conver-
gence of the algorithm.
The specific choice of the signal ratios given in Eq. [6]
is motivated as follows: Instead of the basic ratio FÀ1/F0 which is used with DESS for T2 quantification, we investigate the ratio FÀ1/(F0 À F1), because it shows a stronger sensitivity to T2 (see Fig. 2b where the good T2-sensitivity of this ratio is apparent). For T1 estimation using TESS, another independent ratio is required and we
choose F1/F0 because of its strong sensitivity to T1 (see Fig. 2a). The investigated signal ratios necessarily have
to be bijective functions of either T1 or T2. More precisely, sT2 (T1) (sT1 (T2)) has to be bijective with respect to T1 (T2) which holds for our choice. Otherwise, the minimization might run into local rather than global minima.

considered to be a bound variable: formally, the signal

ratios then depend for any given set of extrinsic parame-

ters (TR, TE1,0,À1, and a) only on one running variable, namely, T1 or T2.
From this, an easy and fast iterative procedure based

on a one-dimensional numerical minimization can be

used for the derivation of T1 and T2, as described in the following: A search interval for T1 and T2 with a (dummy) upper guess of T1,u ¼ T2,u ¼ 5 s is defined. The iteration is initialized with a global estimate for the lon-

gitudinal relaxation time, T1,i¼0 2 [0,T1,u], and a golden section search (29) performed to calculate an estimate for

the transverse relaxation time, T2,iþ1, based on the meas-

Simulations

Optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is not only achieved

at different flip angles for different modes but also

depends on relaxation times (see Fig. 1b,c). We aim at

finding optimal flip angle settings for TESS-based relax-

ometry and analyze the impact of noise on the T1 and T2 calculation. To this end, a Monte-Carlo simulation is

performed for a range of idealized homogeneous T2/T1probes with signal amplitudes according to Eqs. [1–5].

Optimal flip angle settings are explored based on

100,000 F1,0,À1 drawings with mean zero and 0.001M0 standard deviation. The value of the standard deviation

directly relates to the amount of noise in the acquired

MR images. From the sample of noisy signal amplitudes,

distributions of T1,2 with mean <T1,2> and standard deviation DT1,2 are calculated based on Eqs. [6–8]. The SNR for relaxation time mapping using TESS can then

be estimated from SNR T1;T2 :¼ <T1,2>/DT1,2. Relative

SNR is evaluated max{SNR T1 ,SNR T2

according to rSNR T1;T2 } for flip angles ranging

and for T2/T1 ratios ranging from 0.01 to 1.0, using loga-

rithmically spaced T2 values between 10 ms and 1000

ms, but a fixed T1 of 1000 ms.

Measurements
A contemporary DESS sequence was adapted for acquisition of F1, F0, and FÀ1 within every TR, as displayed in Figure 1a. Generally, although not limited to, the same bandwidth was used for the acquisition of all echoes. To provide enough SNR in the base data for T1 and T2 calculation, some averages of the TESS scan were taken as specified below.
In vitro relaxation time mapping with TESS was performed at 1.5 T using manganese-doped spherical phantoms (0 mM, 0.05 mM, 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, 0.5 mM MnCl2 in H2O) of about 14 cm in diameter. Longitudinal relaxation was assessed from single-slice IR turbo spin

echo (TSE) experiments with inversion times ranging between 25 ms and 9.6 s. For a single IR-TSE scan with 2.5 Â 2.5 mm2 in-plane resolution (128 Â 64 matrix) and 5 mm slice thickness, using a turbo factor of 7, a TR of 10 s, a TE of 12 ms, and a bandwidth of 130 Hz/pixel, image acquisition was completed within 1 min 22 s. Transverse relaxation was measured from a contemporary single-echo SE method with a TE ranging from 5 ms up to 3.2 s. One single scan was completed within 3 min 18 s, yielding 2.5 Â 5.0 mm2 in-plane resolution (128 Â 32 matrix) and 5 mm slice thickness, using a turbo factor of 1, a TR of 6 s, and a bandwidth of 592 Hz/pixel. A single-echo rather than a multiecho approach was used to avoid any possible bias in T2 from stimulated echo contributions (30). TESS imaging was performed in 3D with 4 mm isotropic resolution (64 Â 64 Â 44 matrix). Scans were performed with a nominal flip angle of 40 and a constant bandwidth of 240 Hz/pixel for all three echoes, yielding an overall TR of 15.7 ms with corresponding TE1 ¼ 3.6 ms, TE0 ¼ 8.0 ms, and TEÀ1 ¼ 12.4 ms. Four averages were taken and the 3D TESS scan was completed within 2 min and 58 s.
In vivo human knee scans at 3 T of two healthy volunteers were performed with 3D TESS in axial and sagittal orientation (the slab consisted of 12 slices with 3 mm resolution) using a dedicated 15-channel transmit and receive knee coil (QED) yielding 0.6 Â 0.6 mm2 in-plane resolution (256 Â 232 Â 18 image encoding matrix). Imaging was performed with water-selective excitation pulses (121-binomials) of nominal 15 flip angle. The bandwidth was set to 230 Hz/pixel, yielding a TR of 20.6 ms, and corresponding echo times TE1 ¼ 6.6 ms, TE0 ¼ 11.0 ms, and TEÀ1 ¼ 15.4 ms. Seven averages were taken. The 3D TESS scan was completed within 4 min and 24 s. Reference T1 values were calculated from six consecutive IR-TSE scans (12 slices, 0.3 mm gap, 2.7 mm slice thickness, 0.6 Â 0.6 mm2 in-plane resolution using a 256 Â 232 matrix, turbo factor 8, a TR of 6 s, a TE of 10 ms, and a bandwidth of 227 Hz/pixel) with inversion times ranging between 25 ms and 2.35 s. A single scan took 1 min 44 s to complete. Reference T2 values were derived based on nine consecutive single-echo SE scans (12 slices, no gap, 3 mm slice thickness, 0.6 Â 0.6 mm2 in-plane resolution using a 256 Â 232 matrix, turbo factor 1, a TR of 1210 ms, and a bandwidth of 227 Hz/pixel) with corresponding TEs of 10, 20, 30,. . ., 90 ms. One single-echo SE scan was completed within 2 min 39 s. For comparison, a multiecho SE approach (nine echoes: starting from 10 ms, and having an echo spacing of 10 ms) was also used with identical settings as the single-echo scan.
RESULTS
Relaxometry based on TESS is exemplarily illustrated in Figure 3 at 1.5 T for one of the manganese-doped spherical probes (0.25 mM MnCl2 in H2O) with a nominal T1 of 456 ms and a nominal T2 of 48.5 ms, derived by SE techniques (see “Methods” section for details) and regarded in the following as gold standard (31). From a single 3D TESS scan, three different sets of images are acquired (see also Fig. 1a) with formal descriptions as stated in Eqs. [1–5]. From the sT1 signal ratio (see Eq.

FIG. 3. Illustration of iterative relaxometry calculations from F1, F0, and FÀ1 base images, as presented in Eqs. [7] and [8]. The iteration is exemplarily shown for a pixel in the center of the phantom (black cross). Based on the sT1 signal ratio (with an initial guess of T1,0 ¼ 1 s), a guess of T2,1 $ 51.5 ms is derived from Eq. [7] using a golden section search. This first guess of T2 is then used to find an updated estimate of T1,1 $ 483 ms based on Eq. [8], again using a golden section search. This procedure is repeated until the change in both T1 and T2 falls below a certain threshold (here, 0.1 ms); typically, requiring less than 10 iterations. Relaxation parameters were assessed for a region of interest, as indicated in the relaxation maps by the circle. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]
[6]), an estimated T2 value is found (using Eq. [7], and an initial estimate of T1,0 ¼ 1 s). The obtained value is then used to calculate an updated estimate of T1, based on sT2 (see Eqs. [6] and [8]). This procedure is repeated until the iterative change in T1 and T2 falls below a certain threshold (here, 0.1 ms). Typically, the iterative procedure converges very quickly (see Fig. 3). The resulting T1 and T2 maps are also shown in Figure 3, with the relaxometry results summarized in Table 1 for all probes (evaluated for a circular region of interest, placed in the center of the phantoms as indicated in Fig. 3). Generally, excellent agreement is found between reference singleecho SE and TESS transverse relaxometry data. However, some variation is observed for T1 using TESS. Interestingly, no spatial variation can be seen for T2, whereas T1 decreases by about 20% toward the rim of the phantom.
The spatial variation of T1, as observed in vitro (see Fig. 3), is likely to be due to B1 field heterogeneities

FIG. 4. (a) Recalculation of T1 and T2, as presented in Figure 3, but using only half of the nominal flip angle for the calculation, i.e., 20 , instead of 40 . As a result of the dramatic underestimation of the actual flip angle by 50%, T1 is considerably overestimated (1943 ms, instead of 456 ms), but exactly the same value is derived for T2. (b) B1-sensitivity of T1 (top) and T2 (bottom) simulated for the flip angle and relaxation times of the phantom shown in (a). (c) Simulated B1-sensitivity, as shown in (b), over a complete range of flip angles and T2/T1 times. Note the different scales in the sensitivity maps for T1 and T2. [Color figure can be viewed in the online issue, which is available at wileyonlinelibrary.com.]

and thus related to a miscalibration between the nominal (anom) and the actual flip angle (aact) in the probes. This is confirmed by rerunning the calculation, but this time assuming a halved excitation angle, that is with anom ¼ 20 , instead of anom ¼ 40 . As a result, a strongly falsified T1 is observed (see Fig. 4a); however, T2 proves to be completely inert. The sensitivity to transmit field errors, Da :¼ (aact – anom)/anom, is now systematically evaluated, as exemplarily demonstrated in Figure 4b for anom ¼ 40 and T1/T2/TR ¼ 456 ms/48.5 ms/16 ms. The B1-sensitivity of T1, DT1/Da, is about 2, but DT2/Da is barely noticeable, where DT1,2: ¼ (T1,2(aact) À T1,2(anom))/T1,2(anom). This surprising result is not a remarkable coincidence related to a lucky choice of relaxation and sequence parameters, but can be confirmed over a large range of relaxation parameters and flip angles (Fig. 4c). Thus, TESS offers a unique opportunity for fast, accurate, and unbiased T2 quantification, whereas T1 estimates show the expected typical prominent sensitivity of contemporary steady-state methods to B1 field errors, requiring corrective data. The atypical behavior of TESS-T2 is of special advantage and benefit in vivo.
For high-resolution in vivo TESS relaxometry, SNR is expected to become critical and propagation of noise must be evaluated. Corresponding simulation results are shown in Figure 5. The expected relative SNR for T1 (Fig. 5a) and T2 (Fig. 5b) mapping using TESS is strongly affected by the choice of the flip angle (as might already be expected from the corresponding signal curves, see Fig. 1b,c). Generally, a pronounced relative SNR maximum can be observed in both T1 and T2 near a $ 15 with respect to a T2/T1 $ 0.05–0.1, that is, for tissues. As a result, optimal SNR for TESS-based relaxometry can be achieved in the low flip angle and low T2/T1 limit.

FIG. 6. (a) Exemplary axial TESS base images (F1, F0, and FÀ1) of the knee joint at 3 T obtained with water-selective excitation pulses. For better visibility, the signals corresponding to the F1 and FÀ1 mode were multiplied by a factor of 2. (b) T2 values derived either by TESS (left), or by using a single-echo SE approach (middle), or by using a multiecho SE method (right). The manganese-doped test
tubes (0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, and 0.5 mM) serve as internal controls. For selected regions of interest (indicated by the yellow numbers),
T2 values are summarized in Table 2. Again, excellent correspondence is observed in T2 between TESS and single-echo SE data (see also Table 1), whereas the multiecho SE approach shows a clear overestimation of T2 from stimulated echo contributions.

High-resolution in vivo 3D TESS relaxometry is demonstrated in the knee joint at 3 T in axial (Fig. 6) and sagittal (Fig. 7) slice orientation using optimal flip angles for tissues. As an internal control, three small test tubes containing 0.125 mM, 0.25 mM, and 0.5 mM MnCl2 were placed adjacent to the knee for the axial scan. B1-insensitive TESS-T2 quantification is illustrated in Figure 6 and compared with reference T2 maps calculated based on single-echo and multiecho SE experiments. Transverse relaxation time values are assessed for selected regions of interest (for definition of regions of interest, see Fig. 6) with corresponding results summarized in Table 2. Overall, excellent correspondence between TESS and single-echo SE transverse relaxometry data is found, whereas T2 values, derived from multiecho SE data, show a pronounced overestimation of about 30–40% for cartilage, muscle, and for the internal controls due to stimulated echo contributions (from imperfect refocusing pulses and thus due to B1 errors).
The distinct B1-insensitivity of TESS-T2 becomes especially apparent in the sagittal T2 scan (Fig. 7b) where no variation in muscle-T2 can be observed over the complete field of view. This is quite contrary to the corre-

sponding TESS-T1 map (Fig. 7c, right). It appears more inhomogeneous and shows clearly visible variations in muscle-T1 over the field of view originating from B1 heterogeneities. Comparison of TESS-T1 with a reference measurement based on six consecutive IR-TSE scans (Fig. 7c, left) reveals that the T1 map calculated with TESS is flawed as expected. However, good correspondence can be observed in regions where B1 field errors are not that prominent, for instance in the patella: There, TESS relaxometry yields a T1 of 869 6 45 ms for the region of interest indicated by the arrow in Figure 7c compared with a T1 of 839 6 40 ms obtained with IRTSE.
DISCUSSION
A variety of SSFP methods have been proposed thus far and are known in the literature for fast relaxometry, but all of them are sensitive to B1 and show some more or less pronounced mixed T2/T1-sensitivity that can be mitigated by companion scans. As a result, without the use of additional corrective data, current SSFP techniques fail

to deliver accurate, reliable, and stable quantification results.
In this work, we report on a similar approach, as proposed for rapid T2 quantification of cartilage using DESS imaging (28,32). In the limit of a $ 90 , the ratio between the FÀ1 and F0 signal, as acquired with DESS, becomes independent of T1, allowing accurate quantification of T2 (9). Signal-to-noise, however, is especially poor in this limit, requiring considerably lower flip angles in practice and, hence, leading to a systematic T1-related bias in the estimated T2 values using DESS. In principle, we solve this issue by acquiring a third independent mode, namely, F1. Based on two independent signal ratios, the interacting T1- and T2-sensitivity can be tackled by a simple and fast ping-pong approach, using a golden section search, until the calculated signal ratios converge to the actual measured ones. As a result, TESS offers the possibility of acquiring both T1 and T2 within one single scan and without the confounding influence of either T1 on T2 or T2 on T1 (as observed with any other steadystate method). Moreover, from the application of crusher gradients within every TR, TESS is not affected by static field inhomogeneities. However, some motion sensitivity must be taken into account. Therefore, proper fixation seemed mandatory and was carefully conducted before every measurement. Diffusion effects are expected to be negligible for tissues, but reduce the signal of fluids for high-resolution scans (33).
As with any other fast quantitative SSFP imaging technique, TESS-based relaxometry is expected to be affected by B1 field heterogeneities, and the impact of such transmit field calibration errors on T1 and T2 quantification

was analyzed in Figure 4. Surprisingly, T2 relaxometry with TESS revealed to be independent of B1, whereas T1 quantification showed the expected pronounced B1related estimation errors. This extraordinary feature is not only of special interest for high to ultra-high field T2 relaxometry where prominent B1 variations can be expected and applicability of SE techniques might be limited due to SAR constraints but also provides accurate quantification results in combination with spectralspatial excitation pulses that typically entail flip angle calibration errors in the presence of B0 heterogeneities. Spectral-spatial excitation, as demonstrated in Figures 6 and 7 for TESS, is especially beneficial for musculoskeletal imaging where fat is often found adjacent or interspersed within the tissues of interest. Fat suppression may thus not only enhance diagnostic information (34) but also eliminates the chemical shift artefact and thereby allows readout of the SSFP signal modes with a reduced receiver bandwidth which in turn results in an overall increased SNR.

CONCLUSIONS
In contrast to all other existing SSFP quantification techniques, TESS offers rapid T1 and T2 estimation within one single scan. Moreover, quantification of T2 with TESS is markedly insensitive to B1. As a result, the new proposed method is of high interest for fast and reliable relaxometry in the clinical routine, especially for rapid and bias-free T2 imaging of the musculoskeletal system at high to ultra-high field strength.
