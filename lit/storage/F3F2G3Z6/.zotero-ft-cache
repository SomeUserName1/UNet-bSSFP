Abstract:
Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) offers high-resolution in vivo imaging and rich functional and anatomical multimodality tissue contrast. In practice, however, there are challenges associated with considerations of scanning costs, patient comfort, and scanning time that constrain how much data can be acquired in clinical or research studies. In this paper, we explore the possibility of generating high-resolution and multimodal images from low-resolution single-modality imagery. We propose the weakly-supervised joint convolutional sparse coding to simultaneously solve the problems of super-resolution (SR) and cross-modality image synthesis. The learning process requires only a few registered multimodal image pairs as the training set. Additionally, the quality of the joint dictionary learning can be improved using a larger set of unpaired images. To combine unpaired data from different image resolutions/modalities, a hetero-domain image alignment term is proposed. Local image neighborhoods are naturally preserved by operating on the whole image domain (as opposed to image patches) and using joint convolutional sparse coding. The paired images are enhanced in the joint learning process with unpaired data and an additional maximum mean discrepancy term, which minimizes the dissimilarity between their feature distributions. Experiments show that the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques on both SR reconstruction and simultaneous SR and cross-modality synthesis.

1. Introduction

With the rapid progress in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), there are a multitude of mechanisms to generate tissue contrast that are associated with various anatomical or functional features. However, the acquisition of a complete multimodal set of high-resolution images faces constraints associated with scanning costs, scanner availability, scanning time, and patient comfort. In addition, long-term longitudinal studies such as ADNI [24] imply that changes exist in the scanner or acquisition protocol over time. In these situations, it is not uncommon to have images of the same subject but obtained from different sources, or to be confronted with missing or corrupted data from earlier time points. In addition, high-resolution (HR) 3D medical imaging usually requires long breath-hold and repetition times, which lead to long-term scanning times that are challenging or unfeasible in clinical routine. Acquiring low-resolution (LR) images and/or skipping some imaging modalities altogether from the acquisition are then not uncommon. In all such scenarios, it is highly desirable to be able to generate HR data from the desired target modality from the given LR modality data.
