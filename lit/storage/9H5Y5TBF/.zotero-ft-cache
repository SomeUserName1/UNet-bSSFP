As requested by instructors, here is a new edition of the textbook originated by David Halliday and Robert Resnick in 1963 and that I used as a first-year student at MIT. (Gosh, time has flown by.) Constructing this new edition allowed me to discover many delightful new examples and revisit a few favorites from my earlier eight editions. Here below are some highlights of this 12th edition.

PREFACE

In addition, there are problems dealing with • remote detection of the fall of an elderly person, • the illusion of a rising fastball, • hitting a fastball in spite of momentary vision loss, • ship squat in which a ship rides lower in the water in a channel, • the common danger of a bicyclist disappearing from view at an intersection, • measurement of thunderstorm potentials with muons,
and more.
WHAT’S IN THE BOOK
• Checkpoints, one for every module • Sample problems • Review and summary at the end of each chapter • Nearly 300 new end-of-chapter problems
In constructing this new edition, I focused on several areas of research that intrigue me and wrote new text discussions and many new homework problems. Here are a few research areas:
We take a look at the first image of a black hole (for which I have waited my entire life), and then we examine gravitational waves (something I discussed with Rainer Weiss at MIT when I worked in his lab several years before he came up with the idea of using an interferometer as a wave detector).
I wrote a new sample problem and several homework problems on autonomous cars where a computer system must calculate safe driving procedures, such as passing a slow car with an oncoming car in the passing lane.
I explored cancer radiation therapy, including the use of Augur‐Meitner electrons that were first understood by Lise Meitner.
I combed through many thousands of medical, engineering, and physics research articles to find clever ways of looking inside the human body without major invasive surgery. Some are listed in the index under “medical procedures and equipment.” Here are three examples:
(1) Robotic surgery using single‐port incisions and optical fibers now allows surgeons to access internal organs, with patient recovery times of only hours instead of days or weeks as with previous surgery techniques.
(2) Transcranial magnetic stimulation is being used to treat chronic depression, Parkinson’s disease, and other brain malfunctions by applying pulsed magnetic fields from coils near the scalp to force neurons several centimeters deep to discharge.
(3) Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is being used to monitor a person’s brain as the person performs a task such as reading. The task causes weak electrical pulses to be sent along conducting paths between brain cells, and each pulse produces a weak magnetic field that is detected by extremely sensitive SQUIDs.

 THE WILEYPLUS ADVANTAGE

WileyPLUS is a research-based online environment for effective teaching and learning. The customization features, quality question banks, interactive eTextbook, and analytical tools allow you to quickly create a customized course that tracks student learning trends. Your students can stay engaged and on track with the use of intuitive tools like the syncing calendar and the student mobile app. Wiley is committed to providing accessible resources to instructors and students. As such, all Wiley educational products and services are born accessible, designed for users of all abilities.

Links Between Homework Problems and Learning Objectives In WileyPLUS, every ques-
tion and problem at the end of the chapter is linked to a learning objective, to answer the (usually unspoken) questions, “Why am I working this problem? What am I supposed to learn from it?” By being explicit about a problem’s purpose, I believe that a student might better transfer the learning objective to other problems with a different wording but the same key idea. Such transference would help defeat the common trouble that a student learns to work a particular problem but cannot then apply its key idea to a problem in a different setting.

Animations of one of the key figures in each chapter.   Here in the book, those figures are
flagged with the swirling icon. In the online chapter in WileyPLUS, a mouse click begins the ani-

A

mation. I have chosen the figures that are rich in information so that a student can see the physics

in action and played out over a minute or two instead of just being flat on a printed page. Not only

does this give life to the physics, but the animation can be repeated as many times as a student wants.

Video Illustrations  David Maiullo of Rutgers
University has created video versions of approximately 30 of the photographs and figures from the chapters. Much of physics is the study of things that move, and video can often provide better representation than a static photo or figure.

Videos  I have made well over 1500 instructional
videos, with more coming. Students can watch me draw or type on the screen as they hear me talk about a solution, tutorial, sample problem, or review, very much as they would experience were they sitting next to me in my office while I worked out something on a notepad. An instructor’s lectures and tutoring will always be the most valuable learning tools, but my videos are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and can be repeated indefinitely.

• Video tutorials on subjects in the chapters. I chose the subjects that challenge the students the most, the ones that my students scratch their heads about.
• Video reviews of high school math, such as basic algebraic manipulations, trig functions, and simultaneous equations.
• Video introductions to math, such as vector multiplication, that will be new to the students.
• Video presentations of sample problems. My intent is to work out the physics, starting with the key ideas instead of just grabbing a formula. However, I also want to demonstrate how to read a sample problem, that is, how to read technical material to learn problem-solving procedures that can be transferred to other types of problems.
• Video solutions to 20% of the end-of chapter problems. The availability and timing of these solutions are controlled by the instructor. For example, they might be available after a homework deadline or a quiz. Each solution is not simply a plug-and-chug recipe. Rather I build a solution from the key ideas to the first step of reasoning and to a final solution. The student learns not just how to solve a particular problem but how to tackle any problem, even those that require physics courage.
• Video examples of how to read data from graphs (more than simply reading off a number with no comprehension of the physics).
• Many of the sample problems in the textbook are available online in both reading and video formats.

PREFACE

Problem-Solving Help   I have written a large number of resources for WileyPLUS designed to
help build the students’ problem-solving skills.
• Hundreds of additional sample problems. These are available as stand-alone resources but (at the discretion of the instructor) they are also linked out of the homework problems. So, if a homework problem deals with, say, forces on a block on a ramp, a link to a related sample problem is provided. However, the sample problem is not just a replica of the homework problem and thus does not provide a solution that can be merely duplicated without comprehension.
• GO Tutorials for 15% of the end-of-chapter homework problems. In multiple steps, I lead a student through a homework problem, starting with the key ideas and giving hints when wrong answers are submitted. However, I purposely leave the last step (for the final answer) to the students so that they are responsible at the end. Some online tutorial systems trap a student when wrong answers are given, which can generate a lot of frustration. My GO Tutorials are not traps, because at any step along the way, a student can return to the main problem.
• Hints on every end-of-chapter homework problem are available (at the discretion of the instructor). I wrote these as true hints about the main ideas and the general procedure for a solution, not as recipes that provide an answer without any ­comprehension.
• Pre-lecture videos. At an instructor’s discretion, a pre-lecture video is available for every module. Also, assignable questions are available to accompany these videos. The videos were produced by Melanie Good of the University of Pittsburgh.
Evaluation Materials
• Pre-lecture reading questions are available in WileyPLUS for each chapter section. I wrote these so that they do not r­equire analysis or any deep understanding; rather they simply test whether a student has read the section. When a student opens up a section, a randomly chosen reading question (from a bank of questions) appears at the end. The instructor can decide whether the question is part of the grading for that section or whether it is just for the benefit of the student.
• Checkpoints are available within each chapter module. I wrote these so that they require analysis and decisions about the physics in the section. Answers are provided in the back of the book.
• All end-of-chapter homework problems (and many more problems) are available in WileyPLUS. The instructor can construct a homework assignment and control how it is graded when the a­ nswers are submitted online. For example, the instructor controls the deadline for submission and how many attempts a student is allowed on an answer. The instructor also controls which, if any, ­learning aids are available with each homework problem. Such links can include hints, sample problems, in-chapter reading materials, video tutorials, video math reviews, and even video solutions (which can be made available to the students after, say, a homework deadline).
• Symbolic notation problems that require algebraic answers are available in every chapter.
• All end-of-chapter homework questions are available for assignment in WileyPLUS. These questions (in a multiple-choice format) are designed to evaluate the students’ conceptual u­ nderstanding.

• Interactive Exercises and Simulations by Brad Trees of Ohio Wesleyan University. How do we help students understand challenging concepts in physics? How do we motivate students to engage with core content in a meaningful way? The simulations are intended to address these key questions. Each module in the Etext is linked to one or more simulations that convey concepts visually. A simulation depicts a physical situation in which time dependent phenomena are animated and information is presented in multiple representations including a visual representation of the physical system as well as a plot of related variables. Often, adjustable parameters allow the user to change a property of the system and to see the effects of that change on the subsequent behavior. For visual learners, the simulations provide an opportunity to “see” the physics in action. Each simulation is also linked to a set of interactive exercises, which guide the student through a deeper interaction with the physics underlying the simulation. The exercises consist of a series of practice questions with feedback and detailed solutions. Instructors may choose to assign the exercises for practice, to recommend the exercises to students as additional practice, and to show individual simulations during class time to demonstrate a concept and to motivate class discussion.

Icons for Additional Help When worked-out solutions are provided either in print or electronically
for certain of the odd-numbered problems, the statements for those problems include an icon to alert both student and instructor. There are also icons indicating which problems have a GO Tutorial or a link to the The Flying Circus of Physics, which require calculus, and which involve a biomedical application. An icon guide is provided here and at the beginning of each set of problems.

Measurement

1.1  MEASURING THINGS, INCLUDING LENGTHS

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
1.1.1 Identify the base quantities in the SI system. 1.1.2 Name the most frequently used prefixes for
SI units.

1.1.3 Change units (here for length, area, and ­volume) by using chain-­link conversions.
1.1.4 Explain that the meter is defined in terms of the speed of light in a vacuum.

Key Ideas 
● Physics is based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain physical quantities have been chosen as base quantities (such as length, time, and mass); each has been defined in terms of a standard and given a unit of measure (such as meter, second, and kilogram). Other physical quantities are defined in terms of the base quantities and their standards and units.
● The unit system emphasized in this book is the International System of Units (SI). The three physical quantities displayed in Table 1.1.1 are used in the early chapters. Standards, which must be both accessible and invariable, have been established for these base

quantities by ­international agreement. These standards are used in all physical measurement, for both the base quantities and the quantities derived from them. ­Scientific notation and the prefixes of Table 1.1.2 are used to simplify measurement notation.
● Conversion of units may be performed by using chain-­link conversions in which the original data are multiplied successively by conversion factors written as unity and the units are manipulated like algebraic quantities until only the desired units remain.
● The meter is defined as the distance traveled by light during a precisely specified time interval.

What Is Physics?
Science and engineering are based on measurements and comparisons. Thus, we need rules about how things are measured and compared, and we need ­experiments to establish the units for those measurements and comparisons. One purpose of physics (and engineering) is to design and conduct those e­ xperiments.
For example, physicists strive to develop clocks of extreme accuracy so that any time or time interval can be precisely determined and compared. You may wonder whether such accuracy is actually needed or worth the effort. Here is one example of the worth: Without clocks of extreme accuracy, the Global Positioning System (GPS) that is now vital to worldwide navigation would be useless.
Measuring Things
We discover physics by learning how to measure the quantities involved in ­physics. Among these quantities are length, time, mass, temperature, pressure, and electric current.

CHAPTER 1 Measurement

We measure each physical quantity in its own units, by comparison with a standard. The unit is a unique name we assign to measures of that quantity— for example, meter (m) for the quantity length. The standard corresponds to exactly 1.0 unit of the quantity. As you will see, the standard for length, which ­corresponds to exactly 1.0 m, is the distance traveled by light in a vacuum during a ­certain fraction of a second. We can define a unit and its standard in any way we care to. However, the important thing is to do so in such a way that scientists around the world will agree that our definitions are both sensible and practical.
Once we have set up a standard—say, for length—we must work out procedures by which any length whatever, be it the radius of a hydrogen atom, the wheelbase of a skateboard, or the distance to a star, can be expressed in terms of the standard. Rulers, which approximate our length standard, give us one such procedure for measuring length. However, many of our comparisons must be ­indirect. You cannot use a ruler, for example, to measure the radius of an atom or the distance to a star.
Base Quantities.  There are so many physical quantities that it is a problem to organize them. Fortunately, they are not all independent; for example, speed is the ratio of a length to a time. Thus, what we do is pick out—by international ­agreement—a small number of physical quantities, such as length and time, and assign standards to them alone. We then define all other physical quantities in terms of these base quantities and their standards (called base standards). Speed, for ­example, is defined in terms of the base quantities length and time and their base standards.
Base standards must be both accessible and invariable. If we define the length standard as the distance between one’s nose and the index finger on an outstretched arm, we certainly have an accessible standard—but it will, of course, vary from person to person. The demand for precision in science and e­ ngineering pushes us to aim first for invariability. We then exert great effort to make duplicates of the base standards that are accessible to those who need them.

The International System of Units
In 1971, the 14th General Conference on Weights and Measures picked seven quantities as base quantities, thereby forming the basis of the International ­System of Units, abbreviated SI from its French name and popularly known as the metric system. Table 1.1.1 shows the units for the three base quantities— length, mass, and time—that we use in the early chapters of this book. These units were defined to be on a “human scale.”
Many SI derived units are defined in terms of these base units. For example, the SI unit for power, called the watt (W), is defined in terms of the base units for mass, length, and time. Thus, as you will see in Chapter 7,
1 watt = 1 W = 1 kg ⋅ m2/s3,(1.1.1)
where the last collection of unit symbols is read as kilogram-m­ eter squared per second cubed.
To express the very large and very small quantities we often run into in ­physics, we use scientific notation, which employs powers of 10. In this notation,

3 560 000 000 m = 3.56 × 109 m

(1.1.2)

and

0.000 000 492 s = 4.92 × 10−7 s.

(1.1.3)

Scientific notation on computers sometimes takes on an even briefer look, as in 3.56 E9 and 4.92 E–7, where E stands for “exponent of ten.” It is briefer still on some calculators, where E is replaced with an empty space.

1.1  Measuring Things, Including Lengths

3

As a further convenience when dealing with very large or very small measurements, we use the prefixes listed in Table 1.1.2. As you can see, each prefix represents a certain power of 10, to be used as a multiplication factor. Attaching a prefix to an SI unit has the effect of multiplying by the associated factor. Thus, we can express a particular electric power as

1.27 × 109 watts = 1.27 gigawatts = 1.27 GW

(1.1.4)

or a particular time interval as

2.35 × 10−9 s = 2.35 nanoseconds = 2.35 ns.

(1.1.5)

Some prefixes, as used in milliliter, centimeter, kilogram, and megabyte, are ­probably familiar to you.

Changing Units

We often need to change the units in which a physical quantity is expressed. We do so by a method called chain-­link conversion. In this method, we multiply the original measurement by a conversion factor (a ratio of units that is equal to unity). For example, because 1 min and 60 s are identical time intervals, we have

​ _1_6 m_0_ i_sn _​ = 1 and ​_1 _6 m_0_i_sn _ ​ = 1.​
Thus, the ratios (1 min)/(60 s) and (60 s)/(1 min) can be used as conversion ­factors. This is not the same as writing ​_6 1_0  ​ = 1 or 60 = 1​; each number and its unit must be treated together.
Because multiplying any quantity by unity leaves the quantity unchanged, we can introduce conversion factors wherever we find them useful. In chain-link conversion, we use the factors to cancel unwanted units. For example, to convert 2 min to seconds, we have

​2 min = (2 min)(1) = (2 min)​(​ _1_6m_0_i_sn _  )​ ​= 120 s.​

(1.1.6)

If you introduce a conversion factor in such a way that unwanted units do not cancel, invert the factor and try again. In conversions, the units obey the same ­algebraic rules as variables and numbers.
Appendix D gives conversion factors between SI and other systems of units, including non-SI units still used in the United States. However, the conversion factors are written in the style of “1 min = 60 s” rather than as a ratio. So, you need to decide on the numerator and denominator in any needed ratio.

Length
In 1792, the newborn Republic of France established a new system of weights and measures. Its cornerstone was the meter, defined to be one ten-millionth of the distance from the north pole to the equator. Later, for practical reasons, this Earth standard was abandoned and the meter came to be defined as the distance between two fine lines engraved near the ends of a platinum–i­ridium bar, the standard meter bar, which was kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris. Accurate copies of the bar were sent to standardizing laboratories throughout the world. These secondary standards were used to produce other, still more accessible standards, so that ultimately every

4

CHAPTER 1 Measurement

measuring device derived its authority from the standard meter bar through a complicated chain of comparisons.
Eventually, a standard more ­precise than the distance between two fine scratches on a metal bar was required. In 1960, a new standard for the meter, based on the wavelength of light, was adopted. Specifically, the standard for the meter was redefined to be 1 650 763.73 ­wavelengths of a particular orange-­red light emitted by atoms of krypton-86 (a particular isotope, or type, of krypton) in a gas discharge tube that can be set up anywhere in the world. This awkward number of wavelengths was chosen so that the new standard would be close to the old meter-­bar standard.
By 1983, however, the demand for higher precision had reached such a point that even the krypton-86 standard could not meet it, and in that year a bold step was taken. The meter was redefined as the distance traveled by light in a ­specified time interval. In the words of the 17th General Conference on Weights and Measures:

The meter is the length of the path traveled by light in a vacuum during a time ­interval of 1/299 792 458 of a second.

5 × 10−11 1 × 10−15

This time interval was chosen so that the speed of light c is exactly
c = 299 792 458 m/s.
Measurements of the speed of light had become extremely precise, so it made sense to adopt the speed of light as a defined quantity and to use it to redefine the meter.
Table 1.1.3 shows a wide range of lengths, from that of the universe (top line) to those of some very small objects.
Significant Figures and Decimal Places
Suppose that you work out a problem in which each value consists of two digits. Those digits are called significant figures and they set the number of digits that you can use in reporting your final answer. With data given in two significant figures, your final answer should have only two significant figures. However, depending on the mode setting of your calculator, many more digits might be displayed. Those extra digits are meaningless.
In this book, final results of calculations are often rounded to match the least number of significant figures in the given data. (However, sometimes an extra significant figure is kept.) When the leftmost of the digits to be discarded is 5 or more, the last remaining digit is rounded up; otherwise it is retained as is. For example, 11.3516 is rounded to three significant figures as 11.4 and 11.3279 is rounded to three significant figures as 11.3. (The answers to sample problems in this book are usually presented with the symbol = instead of ≈ even if rounding is involved.)
When a number such as 3.15 or 3.15 × 103 is provided in a problem, the number of significant figures is apparent, but how about the number 3000? Is it known to only one significant figure (3 × 103)? Or is it known to as many as four significant figures (3.000 × 103)? In this book, we assume that all the zeros in such given numbers as 3000 are significant, but you had better not make that assumption elsewhere.
Don’t confuse significant figures with decimal places. Consider the lengths 35.6 mm, 3.56 m, and 0.00356 m. They all have three significant figures but they have one, two, and five decimal places, respectively.

We could, of course, take the ball apart and measure the total length L, but that would take great effort and make the ball’s builder most unhappy. Instead, because we want only the nearest order of magnitude, we can estimate any quantities required in the calculation.
Calculations: Let us assume the ball is spherical with radius R = 2 m. The string in the ball is not closely packed (there are uncountable gaps between adjacent sections of string). To allow for these gaps, let us somewhat overestimate the cross-sectional area of the string by assuming the cross section is square, with an edge length d = 4 mm.

Then, with a cross-sectional area of d2 and a length L, the string occupies a total volume of
V = (cross-­sectional area)(length) = d2L.
This is approximately equal to the volume of the ball, given by _​ 43  ​ πR​ 3​,​ which is about 4R3 because π is about 3. Thus, we have the following
d2L = 4R3, or ​L = _​ 4​d_​R_​ 2_​ 3​ ​ ​= _​ (  4__×4_(_​12_0 _  m−​_3​)_​3​m_​  _​)_2​ ​ ​​ 	​ = ​2 × 106​ ​ m ≈ ​106​ ​ m = ​103​ ​ km.​ (Answer)
(Note that you do not need a calculator for such a simplified calculation.) To the nearest order of magnitude, the ball contains about 1000 km of string!

Time
Time has two aspects. For civil and some scientific purposes, we want to know the time of day so that we can order events in sequence. In much scientific work, we want to know how long an event lasts. Thus, any time standard must be able to answer two questions: “When did it happen?” and “What is its duration?” Table 1.2.1 shows some time intervals.
Any phenomenon that repeats itself is a possible time standard. Earth’s ­rotation, which determines the length of the day, has been used in this way for centuries; Fig. 1.2.1 shows one novel example of a watch based on that rotation. A quartz clock, in which a quartz ring is made to vibrate continuously, can be ­calibrated against Earth’s rotation via astronomical observations and used to measure time intervals in the laboratory. However, the calibration cannot be carried out with the accuracy called for by modern scientific and engineering technology.

SFtiegvuerneP1it.k2i.n1  When the metric system

was ­proposed in 1792, the hour was redefined to ­provide a 10-hour day. The idea did not catch on. The maker of this 10-hour watch wisely provided a small dial that kept conventional 12-hour time. Do the two dials indicate the same time?

To meet the need for a better time standard, atomic clocks have been ­developed. An atomic clock at the National Institute of Standards and ­Technology (NIST) in Boulder, Colorado, is the standard for Coordinated ­Universal Time (UTC) in the United States. Its time signals are available by shortwave radio ­(stations WWV and WWVH) and by telephone (303-499-7111). Time s­ ignals (and related information) are also available from
the United States Naval ­Observatory at website https://

­accurately at your particular location, you would have to

Figure 1.2.2 shows variations in the length of one day on

a cesium (atomic) clock. Because the variation displayed by

One second is the time taken by 9 192 631 770 oscillations of the light (of a ­specified wavelength) emitted by a cesium-133 atom.

Atomic clocks are so consistent that, in principle, two cesium clocks would have to
run for 6000 years before their readings would differ by more than 1 s. Even such
accuracy pales in comparison with that of clocks currently being developed; their precision may be 1 part in 1018—that is, 1 s in 1 × 1018 s (which is about 3 × 1010 y).

Mass
The Standard Kilogram
The SI standard of mass is a cylinder of platinum and iridium (Fig. 1.3.1) that is kept at the International Bureau of Weights and Measures near Paris and assigned, by international agreement, a mass of 1 kilogram. Accurate copies have been sent to standardizing laboratories in other countries, and the masses of other bodies can be determined by balancing them against a copy. Table 1.3.1 shows some ­masses expressed in kilograms, ranging over about 83 orders of magnitude.
The U.S. copy of the standard kilogram is housed in a vault at NIST. It is ­removed, no more than once a year, for the purpose of checking duplicate ­copies that are used elsewhere. Since 1889, it has been taken to France twice for recomparison with the primary standard.

Kibble Balance
A far more accurate way of measuring mass is now being adopted. In a Kibble balance (named after its inventor Brian Kibble), a standard mass can be measured when the downward pull on it by gravity is balanced by an upward force from a magnetic field due to an electrical current. The precision of this technique comes from the fact that the electric and magnetic properties can be determined in terms of quantum mechanical quantities that have been precisely defined or measured. Once a standard mass is measured, it can be sent to other labs where the masses of other bodies can be determined from it.

A Second Mass Standard

The masses of atoms can be compared with one another more precisely than they can be compared with the standard kilogram. For this reason, we have a second mass standard. It is the carbon-12 atom, which, by international agreement, has been assigned a mass of 12 atomic mass units (u). The relation b­ etween the two units is

1 u = 1.660 538 86 × 10−27 kg,

(1.3.1)

with an uncertainty of ±10 in the last two decimal places. Scientists can, with ­reasonable precision, experimentally determine the masses of other atoms rel-
ative to the mass of carbon-12. What we presently lack is a reliable means of
­extending that precision to more common units of mass, such as a kilogram.

Density
As we shall discuss further in Chapter 14, density ρ (lowercase Greek letter rho) is the mass per unit volume:

	​​ρ = ​ _mV_  ​.​

(1.3.2)

Densities are typically listed in kilograms per cubic meter or grams per cubic centimeter. The density of water (1.00 gram per cubic centimeter) is often used as a comparison. Fresh snow has about 10% of that density; platinum has a density that is about 21 times that of water.

CHAPTER 1 Measurement

Review & Summary

Measurement in Physics  Physics is based on measurement of physical quantities. Certain physical quantities have been chosen as base quantities (such as length, time, and mass); each has been defined in terms of a standard and given a unit of measure (such as meter, second, and kilogram). Other physical quantities are defined in terms of the base quantities and their standards and units.
SI Units  The unit system emphasized in this book is the International System of Units (SI). The three physical quantities displayed in Table 1.1.1 are used in the early chapters. Standards, which must be both accessible and invariable, have been established for these base quantities by international agreement. These standards are used in all physical measurement, for both the base quantities and the quantities derived from them. Scientific notation and the prefixes of Table 1.1.2 are used to simplify measurement notation.
Changing Units  Conversion of units may be performed by using chain-­link conversions in which the original data are

multiplied successively by conversion factors written as unity and the units are manipulated like algebraic quantities until only the desired units remain.
Length    The meter is defined as the distance traveled by light during a precisely specified time interval.
Time  The second is defined in terms of the oscillations of light emitted by an atomic (cesium-133) source. Accurate time signals are sent worldwide by radio signals keyed to atomic clocks in standardizing laboratories.
Mass  The kilogram is defined in terms of a platinum–­ iridium standard mass kept near Paris. For measurements on an atomic scale, the atomic mass unit, defined in terms of the atom carbon-12, is usually used.
Density  The density ρ of a material is the mass per unit ­volume:
ρ = _​ mV_ ​ .(1.3.2)

2 E A gry is an old English measure for length, defined as 1/10 of a line, where line is another old English measure for length, defined as 1/12 inch. A common measure for length in the publishing business is a point, defined as 1/72 inch. What is an area of 0.50 gry2 in points squared (points2)?

The marks have

been repainted biannually by fraternity pledges since the initial measurement, usually during times of traffic congestion so that the police cannot easily interfere.

Module 1.2   Time 10 E Until 1883, every city and town in the United States kept its own local time. Today, travelers reset their watches only when the time change equals 1.0 h. How far, on the a­ verage, must you travel in degrees of longitude between the time-­zone boundaries at which your watch must be reset by 1.0 h? (Hint: Earth rotates 360° in about 24 h.)
11 E For about 10 years after the French Revolution, the French government attempted to base measures of time on multiples of ten: One week consisted of 10 days, one day consisted of 10 hours, one hour consisted of 100 minutes, and one minute consisted of 100 seconds. What are the ratios of (a) the French decimal week to the standard week and (b) the French decimal second to the standard second?

13 E GO Three digital clocks A, B, and C run at different rates and do not have simultaneous readings of zero. Figure 1.3 shows simultaneous readings on pairs of the clocks for four occasions. (At the earliest occasion, for example, B reads 25.0 s and C reads 92.0 s.) If two events are 600 s apart on clock A, how far apart are they on (a) clock B and (b) clock C? (c) When clock A reads 400 s, what does clock B read? (d) When clock C reads 15.0 s, what does clock B read? (Assume negative readings for prezero times.)

15 E A fortnight is a charming English measure of time equal to 2.0 weeks (the word is a contraction of “fourteen nights”). That is a nice amount of time in pleasant company but perhaps a painful string of microseconds in unpleasant company. How many microseconds are in a fortnight?
16 E Time standards are now based on atomic clocks. A promising second standard is based on pulsars, which are rotating neutron stars (highly compact stars consisting only of neutrons). Some rotate at a rate that is highly stable, sending out a radio beacon that sweeps briefly across Earth once with each rotation, like a lighthouse beacon. Pulsar PSR 1937 + 21 is an example; it rotates once every 1.557 806 448 872 75 ± 3 ms, where the trailing ±3 indicates the uncertainty in the last decimal place (it does not mean ±3 ms). (a) How many rotations does PSR 1937 + 21 make in 7.00 days? (b) How much time does the pulsar take to rotate exactly one m­ illion times and (c) what is the associated uncertainty?

19 H Suppose that, while lying on a beach near the equator watching the Sun set over a calm ocean, you start a stopwatch just as the top of the Sun disappears.

25 M FCP During heavy rain, a section of a mountainside measuring 2.5 km horizontally, 0.80 km up along the slope, and 2.0 m deep slips into a valley in a mud slide.

(b) How many 1-liter pop bottles would that water fill? (c) Water has a density of 1000 kg/m3. How much mass does the water in the cloud have?
27 M Iron has a density of 7.87 g/cm3, and the mass of an iron atom is 9.27 × 10−26 kg. If the atoms are spherical and tightly packed, (a) what is the volume of an iron atom and (b) what is the distance between the centers of adjacent atoms?
28 M A mole of atoms is 6.02 × 1023 atoms. To the nearest ­order of magnitude, how many moles of atoms are in a large domestic cat? The masses of a hydrogen atom, an oxygen atom, and a carbon atom are 1.0 u, 16 u, and 12 u, respectively. (Hint: Cats are sometimes known to kill a mole.)
29 M On a spending spree in Malaysia, you buy an ox with a weight of 28.9 piculs in the local unit of weights: 1 picul = 100 gins, 1 gin = 16 tahils, 1 tahil = 10 chees, and 1 chee = 10 hoons. The weight of 1 hoon corresponds to a mass of 0.3779 g. When you arrange to ship the ox home to your ­astonished family, how much mass in kilograms must you d­ eclare on the shipping manifest?

33 SSM A ton is a measure of volume frequently used in shipping, but that use requires some care because there are at least three types of tons: A displacement ton is equal to 7 barrels bulk, a freight ton is equal to 8 barrels bulk, and a register ton is equal to 20 barrels bulk. A barrel bulk is another measure of volume: 1 barrel bulk = 0.1415 m3. Suppose you spot a shipping order for “73 tons” of M&M candies, and you are certain that the client who sent the order intended “ton” to ­refer to volume (instead of weight or mass, as discussed in Chapter 5). If the client actually meant displacement tons, how many extra U.S. bushels of the candies will you erroneously ship if you interpret the order as (a) 73 freight tons and (b) 73 register tons? (1 m3 = 28.378 U.S. bushels.)
34   Two types of barrel units were in use in the 1920s in the United States. The apple barrel had a legally set volume of 7056 cubic inches; the cranberry barrel, 5826 cubic inches.

What was the total area in (a) the old unit of roods and (b) the more modern unit of square meters? Here, 1 acre is an area of 40 perches by 4 perches, 1 rood is an area of 40 perches by 1 perch, and 1 perch is the length 16.5 ft.
39 SSM A tourist purchases a car in England and ships it home to the United States. The car sticker advertised that the car’s fuel consumption was at the rate of 40 miles per gallon on the open road. The tourist does not realize that the U.K. gallon differs from the U.S. gallon:

1 U.K. gallon = 4.546 090 0 liters 1 U.S. gallon = 3.785 411 8 liters.

For a trip of 750 miles (in the United States), how many gallons of fuel does (a) the mistaken tourist believe she needs and (b) the car actually require?
40  Using conversions and data in the chapter, determine the number of hydrogen atoms required to obtain 1.0 kg of ­hydrogen. A hydrogen atom has a mass of 1.0 u.
41 SSM A cord is a volume of cut wood equal to a stack 8 ft long, 4 ft wide, and 4 ft high. How many cords are in 1.0 m3?

44   What mass of water fell on the town in Problem 7? Water has a density of 1.0 × 103 kg/m3.
45   (a) A unit of time sometimes used in microscopic physics is the shake. One shake equals 10−8 s. Are there more shakes in a second than there are seconds in a year? (b) Humans have existed for about 106 years, whereas the ­universe is about 1010 years old. If the age of the universe is defined as 1 “universe day,” where a universe day consists of “universe seconds” as a normal day consists of normal seconds, how many universe seconds have humans existed?

46   A unit of area often used in measuring land areas is the hectare, defined as 104 m2. An open-­pit coal mine consumes 75 hectares of land, down to a depth of 26 m, each year. What volume of earth, in cubic kilometers, is removed in this time?
47 SSM An astronomical unit (AU) is the average distance ­between Earth and the Sun, approximately 1.50 × 108 km. The speed of light is about 3.0 × 108 m/s. Express the speed of light in astronomical units per minute.
48   The common Eastern mole, a mammal, typically has a mass of 75 g, which corresponds to about 7.5 moles of atoms. (A mole of atoms is 6.02 × 1023 atoms.) In atomic mass units (u), what is the average mass of the atoms in the common Eastern mole?

50  You receive orders to sail due east for 24.5 mi to put your salvage ship directly over a sunken pirate ship. However, when your divers probe the ocean floor at that ­location and find no evidence of a ship, you radio back to your source of information, only to discover that the sailing ­distance was supposed to be 24.5 nautical miles, not regular miles. Use the Length table in Appendix D to calculate how far horizontally you are from the pirate ship in ­kilometers.
51  Density and liquefaction. A heavy object can sink into the ground during an earthquake if the shaking causes the ground to undergo liquefaction, in which the soil grains experience little friction as they slide over one another. The ground is then effectively quicksand. The possibility of liquefaction in sandy ground can be predicted in terms of the void ratio e for a sample of the ground: e = Vvoids/Vgrains. Here, Vgrains is the total volume of the sand grains in the sample and Vvoids is the total volume between the grains (in the voids). If e exceeds a critical value of 0.80, liquefaction can occur during an earthquake. What is the corresponding sand density ρsand? Solid silicon dioxide (the primary component of sand) has a density of ​ρ​ ​ ​SiO​ 2​​ = 2.600 × ​10​3​ kg/m3​ ​.​
52  Billion and trillion. Until 1974, the U.S. and the U.K. used the same names to mean different large numbers. Here are two examples: In American English a billion means a number with 9 zeros after the 1 and in British English it formerly meant a number with 12 zeros after the 1. In American English a trillion means a number with 12 zeros after the 1 and in British English it formerly meant a number with 18 zeros after the 1. In scientific notation with the prefixes in Table 1.1.2, what is 4.0 billion meters in (a) the American use and (b) the former British use? What is 5.0 trillion meters in (c) the American use and (d) the former British use?
53  Townships. In the United States, real estate can be measured in terms of townships: 1 township = 36 mi2, 1 mi2 = 640 acres, 1 acre = 4840 yd2, 1 yd2 = 9 ft2. If you own 3.0 townships, how many square feet of real estate do you own?
54  Measures of a man. Leonardo da Vinci, renowned for his understanding of human anatomy, valued the measures of a man stated by Vitruvius Pollio, a Roman architect and engineer of the first century BC: four fingers make one palm, four palms make one foot, six palms make one cubit, and four cubits make a man’s height. If we take a finger width to be 0.75 in., what then

are (a) the length of a man’s foot and (b) the height of a man, both in centimeters?
55  Dog years. Dog owners like to convert the age of a dog (dubbed dog years) to the usual meaning of years to account for the more rapid aging of dogs. One measure of the aging process in both dogs and humans is the rate at which the DNA changes in a process called methylation. Research on that process shows that after the first year, the equivalent age of a dog is given by
equivalent age = 16 ln(dog years) + 31,
where ln is the natural logarithm. What then is the equivalent age of a dog on its 13th birthday?
56  Galactic years. The time the Solar System takes to circle around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, a galactic year, is about 230 My. In galactic years, how long ago did (a) the Tyrannosaurus rex dinosaurs live (67 My ago), (b) the first major ice age occur (2.2 Gy ago), and (c) Earth form (4.54 Gy ago)?
57  Planck time. The smallest time interval defined in physics is the Planck time ​t​​ P​ = 5.39 × ​10​−44​s​, which is the time required for light to travel across a certain length in a vacuum. The universe began with the big bang 13.772 billion years ago. What is the number of Planck times since that beginning?
58  20,000 Leagues Under the Sea. In Jules Verne’s classic science fiction story (published as a serial from 1869 to 1870), Captain Nemo travels in his underwater ship Nautilus through the seas of the world for a distance of 20,000 leagues, where a (metric) league is equal to 4.000 km. Assume Earth is spherical with a radius of 6378 km. How many times could Nemo have traveled around Earth?
59  Sea mile. A sea mile is a commonly used measure of distance in navigation but, unlike the nautical mile, it does not have a fixed value because it depends on the latitude at which it is measured. It is the distance measured along any given longitude that subtends 1 arc minute, as measured from Earth’s center (Fig. 1.5). That distance depends on the radius r of Earth at that point, but because Earth is not a perfect sphere but is wider at the equator and has slightly flattened polar regions, the radius depends on the latitude. At the equator, the radius is 6378 km; at the pole it is 6356 km. What is the difference in a sea mile measured at the equator and at the pole?

60  Noctilucent clouds. Soon after the huge 1883 volcanic explosion of Krakatoa Island (near Java in the southeast Pacific), silvery, blue clouds began to appear nightly in the Northern Hemisphere early at night. The explosion was so violent that it hurled dust to the mesosphere, a cool portion of the atmosphere located well above the stratosphere. There water collected and froze on the dust to form the particles that made the first of these clouds. Termed noctilucent clouds (“night shining”), these clouds are now appearing frequently (Fig. 1.6a), signaling a major change in Earth’s atmosphere, not because of volcanic explosions, but because of the increased production of methane by industries, rice paddies, landfills, and livestock flatulence.
The clouds are visible after sunset because they are in the upper portion of the atmosphere that is still illuminated by sunlight. Figure 1.6b shows the situation for an observer at point A who sees the clouds overhead 38 min after sunset. The two lines of light are tangent to Earth’s surface at A and B, at radius r from Earth’s center. Earth rotates through angle θ between the two lines of light. What is the height H of the clouds?

CHAPTER

2

Motion Along a Straight Line

2.1  POSITION, DISPLACEMENT, AND AVERAGE VELOCITY

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
2.1.1 Identify that if all parts of an object move in the same direction and at the same rate, we can treat the object as if it were a (point-­like) particle. (This chapter is about the motion of such objects.)
2.1.2 Identify that the position of a particle is its location as read on a scaled axis, such as an x axis.
2.1.3 Apply the relationship between a particle’s ­displacement and its initial and final positions.

2.1.4 Apply the relationship between a particle’s average ­velocity, its displacement, and the time interval for that ­displacement.
2.1.5 Apply the relationship between a particle’s average speed, the total distance it moves, and the time interval for the motion.
2.1.6 Given a graph of a particle’s position versus time, ­determine the average velocity between any two particular times.

Key Ideas 
● The position x of a particle on an x axis locates the particle with respect to the origin, or zero point, of the axis.
● The position is either positive or negative, according to which side of the origin the particle is on, or zero if the particle is at the origin. The positive direction on an axis is the direction of increasing positive numbers; the opposite direction is the negative direction on the axis.
● The displacement Δ x of a particle is the change in its ­position:
​Δ x = x​ ​ 2​ − ​x​ 1​.​
● Displacement is a vector quantity. It is positive if the ­particle has moved in the positive direction of the x axis and negative if the particle has moved in the negative ­direction.
● When a particle has moved from position x1 to position x2 during a time interval Δt = t2 − t1, its average velocity during that interval is

​​v​ avg​ = ​ Δ_Δ_ x_ t  ​= ​ ​x_​t​ 2_​ 2​​_−−__​x​t​ 1_​ 1​ ​​ .​
● The algebraic sign of vavg indicates the direction of motion (vavg is a vector quantity). Average velocity does not depend on the actual distance a particle moves, but instead depends on its original and final positions.
● On a graph of x versus t, the average velocity for a time interval Δt is the slope of the straight line connecting the points on the curve that represent the two ends of the interval.
● The average speed savg of a particle during a time ­interval Δt depends on the total distance the particle moves in that time interval:
​s​ avg​ =   ​ _to_t_a_l_d_Δi  _st_  ta_n_​ c_e_  .​

What Is Physics?
One purpose of physics is to study the motion of objects—how fast they move, for example, and how far they move in a given amount of time. NASCAR ­engineers are fanatical about this aspect of physics as they determine the perform­ance of their cars before and during a race. Geologists use this physics to measure ­tectonic-­plate motion as they attempt to predict earthquakes. Medical ­researchers need this physics to map the blood flow through a patient when ­diagnosing a partially closed artery, and motorists use it to determine how they might slow sufficiently when their radar detector sounds a warning. There are countless other
13

CHAPTER 2  Motion Along a Straight Line

examples. In this chapter, we study the basic physics of ­motion where the object (race car, tectonic plate, blood cell, or any other object) moves along a single axis. Such motion is called one-­dimensional motion.

Motion
The world, and everything in it, moves. Even seemingly stationary things, such as a roadway, move with Earth’s rotation, Earth’s orbit around the Sun, the Sun’s orbit around the center of the Milky Way galaxy, and that galaxy’s migration relative to other galaxies. The classification and comparison of motions (called kinematics) is often challenging. What exactly do you measure, and how do you compare?
Before we attempt an answer, we shall examine some general properties of motion that is restricted in three ways.
1. The motion is along a straight line only. The line may be vertical, horizontal, or slanted, but it must be straight.
2. Forces (pushes and pulls) cause motion but will not be discussed until ­Chapter 5. In this chapter we discuss only the motion itself and changes in the motion. Does the moving object speed up, slow down, stop, or reverse ­direction? If the motion does change, how is time involved in the change?
3. The moving object is either a particle (by which we mean a point-l­ike object such as an electron) or an object that moves like a particle (such that every portion moves in the same direction and at the same rate). A stiff pig s­ lipping down a straight playground slide might be considered to be moving like a particle; however, a tumbling tumbleweed would not.

Origin

Figure 2.1.1  Position is determined on an axis that is marked in units of length (here meters) and that ­extends indefinitely in opposite ­directions. The axis name, here x, is always on the positive side of the origin.

Position and Displacement
To locate an object means to find its position relative to some reference point, often the origin (or zero point) of an axis such as the x axis in Fig. 2.1.1. The ­positive direction of the axis is in the direction of increasing numbers (coordinates), which is to the right in Fig. 2.1.1. The opposite is the negative direction.
For example, a particle might be located at x = 5 m, which means it is 5 m in the positive direction from the origin. If it were at x = −5 m, it would be just as far from the origin but in the opposite direction. On the axis, a coordinate of −5 m is less than a coordinate of −1 m, and both coordinates are less than a c­ oordinate of +5 m. A plus sign for a coordinate need not be shown, but a m­ inus sign must always be shown.
A change from position x1 to position x2 is called a displacement Δx, where

Δx = x2 − x1.

(2.1.1)

(The symbol Δ, the Greek uppercase delta, represents a change in a quantity, and it means the final value of that quantity minus the initial value.) When num-
bers are inserted for the position values x1 and x2 in Eq. 2.1.1, a displacement in the positive direction (to the right in Fig. 2.1.1) always comes out positive, and
a displacement in the opposite direction (left in the figure) always comes out
­negative. For example, if the particle moves from x1 = 5 m to x2 = 12 m, then the displacement is Δx = (12  m) − (5  m) = +7  m. The positive result indicates that the motion is in the positive direction. If, instead, the particle moves from x1 = 5 m to x2 = 1 m, then Δx = (1 m) − (5 m) = −4 m. The negative result indicates that the motion is in the negative direction.
The actual number of meters covered for a trip is irrelevant; displacement
involves only the original and final positions. For example, if the particle moves

for all times t.

from x = 5 m out to x = 200 m and then back to x = 5 m, the displacement from start to finish is Δx = (5 m) − (5 m) = 0.
Signs.  A plus sign for a displacement need not be shown, but a minus sign must ­always be shown. If we ignore the sign (and thus the direction) of a displacement, we are left with the magnitude (or absolute value) of the displacement. For example, a displacement of Δx = −4 m has a magnitude of 4 m.
Displacement is an example of a vector quantity, which is a quantity that has both a direction and a magnitude. We explore vectors more fully in Chapter 3, but here all we need is the idea that displacement has two features: (1) Its magnitude is the distance (such as the number of meters) between the original and final positions. (2) Its direction, from an original position to a final position, can be represented by a plus sign or a minus sign if the motion is along a single axis.
Here is the first of many checkpoints where you can check your understanding with a bit of reasoning. The answers are in the back of the book.

Checkpoint 2.1.1
Here are three pairs of initial and final positions, respectively, along an x axis. Which pairs give a negative displacement: (a) −3 m, +5 m; (b) −3 m, −7 m;  (c) 7 m, −3 m?

Average Velocity and Average Speed

A compact way to describe position is with a graph of position x plotted as a func-
tion of time t—a graph of x(t). (The notation x(t) represents a function x of t, not
the product x times t.) As a simple example, Fig. 2.1.2 shows the position function
x(t) for a stationary armadillo (which we treat as a particle) over a 7 s time inter-
val. The animal’s position stays at x = −2 m. Figure 2.1.3 is more interesting, because it involves motion. The armadillo
is apparently first noticed at t = 0 when it is at the position x = −5 m. It moves ­toward x = 0, passes through that point at t = 3 s, and then moves on to increasingly larger positive values of x. Figure 2.1.3 also depicts the straight-­line motion
of the armadillo (at three times) and is something like what you would see. The
graph in Fig. 2.1.3 is more abstract, but it reveals how fast the armadillo moves.
Actually, several quantities are associated with the phrase “how fast.” One
of them is the average velocity vavg, which is the ratio of the displacement Δx that occurs during a particular time interval Δt to that interval:

	​​v​ avg​ = ​ Δ_Δ_ x_t  ​= ​ ​x_​t​ 2_​ 2​​_−−__​x​t​ 1_​ 1​ ​​ .​	

(2.1.2)

The notation means that the position is x1 at time t1 and then x2 at time t2. A common unit for vavg is the meter per second (m/s). You may see other units in the problems, but they are always in the form of length/time.

Graphs.  On a graph of x versus t, vavg is the slope of the straight line that connects two particular points on the x(t) curve: one is the point that corresponds
to x2 and t2, and the other is the point that corresponds to x1 and t1. Like displacement, vavg has both magnitude and direction (it is another vector quantity). Its magnitude is the magnitude of the line’s slope. A positive vavg (and slope) tells us that the line slants upward to the right; a negative vavg (and slope) tells us that the line slants downward to the right. The average velocity vavg ­always has the same sign as the displacement Δx because Δt in Eq. 2.1.2 is always positive.
Figure 2.1.4 shows how to find vavg in Fig. 2.1.3 for the time interval t = 1 s to t = 4 s. We draw the straight line that connects the point on the position curve at the beginning of the interval and the point on the curve at the end of the interval.
Then we find the slope Δx/Δt of the straight line. For the given time interval, the average velocity is
​​v​ avg​ = ​ _63_m_s_ ​ = 2 m / s.​

2.1  POSITION, DISPLACEMENT, AND AVERAGE VELOCITY

17

Average speed savg is a different way of describing “how fast” a particle moves. Whereas the average velocity involves the particle’s displacement Δx, the average speed involves the total distance covered (for example, the number of
meters moved), independent of direction; that is,

	​​​s​ avg​ =   ​ _to_t_a_l_d_Δi  _s t_t  a_n_c_e_  ​ .​​￼	

(2.1.3)

Because average speed does not include direction, it lacks any algebraic sign.

Sometimes savg is the same (except for the absence of a sign) as vavg. However, the two can be quite different.

Sample Problem 2.1.1 Average velocity
You get a lift from a car service to take you to a state park along a straight road due east (directly toward the east) for 10.0 km at an average velocity of 40.0 km/h. From the drop-­off point, you jog along a straight path due east for 3.00 km, which takes 0.500 h.
(a)  What is your overall displacement from your starting point to the point where your jog ends?
KEY IDEA
For convenience, assume that you move in the positive direction of an x axis, from a first position of x1 = 0 to a second position of x2 at the end of the jog. That second position must be at x2 = 10.0 km + 3.00 km = 13.0 km. Then your displacement ∆x along the x axis is the second position minus the first position.
Calculation:  From Eq. 2.1.1, we have Δx = x2 − x1 = 13.0 − 0 = 13.0 km. (Answer)
Thus, your overall displacement is 13.0 km in the positive ­direction of the x axis.
(b)  What is the time interval Δt from the beginning of your movement to the end of the jog?
KEY IDEA
We already know the jogging time interval ∆ tjog (= 0.500 h), but we lack the time interval ∆ tcar for the ride. However, we know that the displacement ∆ xcar is 10.0 km and the average velocity vavg,car is 40.0 km/h. That average velocity is the ratio of that displacement to the time interval for the ride, so we can find that time interval.
Calculations:  We first write
​v​ avg,car​ = ​ ​Δ_​Δ_x_tcc​ ​  _aa_rr​ ​ ​.​ Rearranging and substituting data then give us
​Δtc​  ar​ = ​  _​v​Δ_​ av_xg_c​  ,ac_ar_​ r​ ​ = ​ _4_10_0.0_.0_k_km_m_ / h  _ ​  = 0.250 h.​

So,

￼​Δt = ​Δt​ car​ + ​Δtj​  og​

= 0.250 h + 0.500 h = 0.750 h.​ (Answer)

(c)  What is your average velocity vavg from the starting point to the end of the jog? Find it both numerically and
graphically.

KEY IDEA

From Eq. 2.1.2 we know that vavg for the entire trip is the ratio of the displacement of 13.0 km for the entire trip to the time interval of 0.750 h for the entire trip.
Calculation:  Here we find

​v​ avg​ = ​ Δ_Δ_x_t  ​= _​ 10_3.7_.05_0_k_mh_ ​ = 17.3 km / h.​

(Answer)

To find vavg graphically, first we graph the function x(t) as shown in Fig. 2.1.5, where the beginning and final points
on the graph are the origin and the point labeled “Stop.”

18

CHAPTER 2  Motion Along a Straight Line

Your average velocity is the slope of the straight line connecting those points; that is, vavg is the ratio of the rise (∆ x = 13.0 km) to the run (∆ t = 0.750 h), which gives us vavg = 17.3 km/h.
(d)  Suppose you then jog back to the drop-­off point for another 0.500 h. What is your average speed from the beginning of your trip to that return?

KEY IDEA

Your average speed is the ratio of the total distance you ­covered to the total time interval you took.

Calculation:  The total distance is 10.0 km + 3.00 km + 3.00 km = 16.0 km. The total time interval is 0.250 h + 0.500 h + 0.500 h = 1.25 h. Thus, Eq. 2.1.3 gives us

​s​ avg​ = _​ 1_16_..20_5_k_hm_ ​   = 12.8 km / h.​

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .

Key Ideas 
● The instantaneous velocity (or simply velocity) v of a moving particle is
​v = ​ Δlitm→0​ ​  Δ_Δ_x_t  ​= _​ dd_xt_  ​,​ where Δx = x2 − x1 and Δt = t2 − t1.

● The instantaneous velocity (at a particular time) may be found as the slope (at that particular time) of the graph of x versus t.
● Speed is the magnitude of instantaneous velocity.

Instantaneous Velocity and Speed
You have now seen two ways to describe how fast something moves: average ­velocity and average speed, both of which are measured over a time interval Δt. However, the phrase “how fast” more commonly refers to how fast a ­particle is moving at a given instant—its instantaneous velocity (or simply ­velocity) v.
The velocity at any instant is obtained from the average velocity by shrinking the time interval Δt closer and closer to 0. As Δt dwindles, the average v­ elocity approaches a limiting value, which is the velocity at that instant:

	​ ​v = ​ Δlitm→0​ ​  Δ_Δ_x_t  ​= _​ dd_xt_  ​.​​	

(2.2.1)

Note that v is the rate at which position x is changing with time at a given i­nstant; that is, v is the derivative of x with respect to t. Also note that v at any instant is the slope of the position–­time curve at the point representing that instant. Velocity is another vector quantity and thus has an associated ­direction.
Speed is the magnitude of velocity; that is, speed is velocity that has been stripped of any indication of direction, either in words or via an algebraic sign. (Caution: Speed and average speed can be quite different.) A velocity of +5 m/s and one of −5 m/s both have an associated speed of 5 m/s. The speedometer in a car measures speed, not velocity (it cannot determine the direction).

Checkpoint 2.2.1
The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four situations (in each equation, x is in meters, t is in seconds, and t > 0): (1) x = 3t − 2; (2) x = −4t2 − 2; (3) x = 2/t2; and (4) x = −2. (a) In which situation is the velocity v of the particle constant? (b) In which is v in the negative x direction?

Sample Problem 2.2.1 Velocity and slope of x versus t, elevator cab

Figure 2.2.1a is an x(t) plot for an elevator cab that is initially stationary, then moves upward (which we take to be the positive direction of x), and then stops. Plot v(t).
KEY IDEA
We can find the velocity at any time from the slope of the x(t) curve at that time.
x

Calculations: The slope of x(t), and so also the velocity, is

zero in the intervals from 0 to 1 s and from 9 s on, so then

the cab is stationary. During the interval bc, the slope is

constant and nonzero, so then the cab moves with con-

stant velocity. We calculate the slope of x(t) then as

​ Δ_Δ_x_t  ​= v =   _​ 28  _4._0m_s__−−  _  4_3_..00__ms_ ​ = + 4.0 m / s.​

CHAPTER 2  Motion Along a Straight Line

The plus sign indicates that the cab is moving in the positive x direction. These intervals (where v = 0 and v = 4 m/s) are plotted in Fig. 2.2.1b. In addition, as the cab initially begins to move and then later slows to a stop, v varies as indicated in the intervals 1 s to 3 s and 8 s to 9 s. Thus, Fig. 2.2.1b is the ­required plot. (Figure 2.2.1c is considered in Module 2.3.)
Given a v(t) graph such as Fig. 2.2.1b, we could “work backward” to produce the shape of the associated x(t) graph (Fig. 2.2.1a). However, we would not know the actual values for x at various times, because the v(t) graph indicates only changes in x. To find such a change in x during any interval, we must, in the language of

calculus, calculate the area ­“under the curve” on the v(t) graph for that interval. For e­xample, during the ­interval 3 s to 8 s in which the cab has a velocity of 4.0 m/s, the change in x is
Δx = (4.0 m/s)(8.0 s − 3.0 s) = +20 m. (2.2.3)
(This area is positive because the v(t) curve is above the t axis.) Figure 2.2.1a shows that x does indeed increase by 20 m in that interval. However, Fig. 2.2.1b does not tell us the values of x at the beginning and end of the interval. For that, we need additional information, such as the value of x at some instant.

2.3 ACCELERATION
Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
2.3.1 Apply the relationship between a particle’s average acceleration, its change in velocity, and the time interval for that change.
2.3.2 Given a particle’s velocity as a function of time, calculate the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time.
Key Ideas 
● Average acceleration is the ratio of a change in velocity Δv to the time interval Δt in which the change occurs:
​a​ avg​ = ​ Δ_Δ_v_t  ​.​
The algebraic sign indicates the direction of aavg.

2.3.3 Given a graph of a particle’s velocity versus time, determine the instantaneous acceleration for any particular time and the average acceleration between any two particular times.
● Instantaneous acceleration (or simply acceleration) a is the first time derivative of velocity v(t) and the second time derivative of position x(t):
​a = _​ dd_vt_  ​= ​ _​d​d_​ 2t_​ ​ 2x_​ ​ .​ ● On a graph of v versus t, the acceleration a at any time t is the slope of the curve at the point that represents t.

Acceleration

When a particle’s velocity changes, the particle is said to undergo acceleration
(or to accelerate). For motion along an axis, the average acceleration aavg over a time interval Δt is

​​a​ avg​ = _​ ​v​t_​ ​ 22​​_−−__​v​t​ 1_​ 1​ ​​ = ​ Δ_Δ_v_t  ​,​

(2.3.1)

where the particle has velocity v1 at time t1 and then velocity v2 at time t2. The ­instantaneous acceleration (or simply acceleration) is

​a = _​ dd_vt_  .​​

(2.3.2)

2.3 ACCELERATION

21

In words, the acceleration of a particle at any instant is the rate at which its ­velocity is changing at that instant. Graphically, the acceleration at any point is the slope of the curve of v(t) at that point. We can combine Eq. 2.3.2 with Eq. 2.2.1 to write

	​ a = _​ dd_vt_  ​= _​ dd_t  ​ ​(​ _dd_xt_  ​)​ = ​ _​d​d_​ 2t_​x​ 2_​ ​ .​(2.3.3)

In words, the acceleration of a particle at any instant is the second derivative of

its position x(t) with respect to time.

A common unit of acceleration is the meter per second per second: m/(s ⋅ s) or m/s2. Other units are in the form of length/(time ⋅ time) or length/time2. Acceleration has both magnitude and direction (it is yet another vector quantity). Its

algebraic sign represents its direction on an axis just as for displacement and

velocity; that is, acceleration with a positive value is in the positive direction of

an axis, and acceleration with a negative value is in the negative direction.

Figure 2.2.1 gives plots of the position, velocity, and acceleration of an

elevator moving up a shaft. Compare the a(t) curve with the v(t) curve—each point on the a(t) curve shows the derivative (slope) of the v(t) curve at the

corres­ponding time. When v is constant (at either 0 or 4 m/s), the derivative

is zero and so also is the acceleration. When the cab first begins to move, the

v(t) curve has a positive derivative (the slope is positive), which means that a(t)

is positive. When the cab slows to a stop, the derivative and slope of the v(t)

curve are negative; that is, a(t) is negative.

Next compare the slopes of the v(t) curve during the two acceleration periods. The slope associated with the cab’s slowing down (commonly called

­“deceleration”) is steeper because the cab stops in half the time it took to get

up to speed. The steeper slope means that the magnitude of the deceleration is

larger than that of the acceleration, as indicated in Fig. 2.2.1c.

Sensations. The sensations you would feel while riding in the cab of

Fig. 2.2.1 are indicated by the sketched figures at the bottom. When the cab first

accelerates, you feel as though you are pressed downward; when later the cab is

braked to a stop, you seem to be stretched upward. In between, you feel nothing special. In other words, your body reacts to accelerations (it is an accelerometer)

but not to v­ elocities (it is not a speedometer). When you are in a car traveling at

90 km/h or an airplane traveling at 900 km/h, you have no bodily awareness of the

­motion. However, if the car or plane quickly changes velocity, you may become

keenly aware of the change, perhaps even frightened by it. Part of the thrill of an

amusement park ride is due to the quick changes of velocity that you undergo

(you pay for the accelerations, not for the speed). A more extreme example is shown in the photographs of Fig. 2.3.1, which were taken while a rocket sled was

rapidly accelerated along a track and then rapidly braked to a stop.

FCP

g Units.  Large accelerations are sometimes expressed in terms of g units, with

1g = 9.8 m/s2   (g unit).

(2.3.4)

(As we shall discuss in Module 2.5, g is the magnitude of the acceleration of a fall-
ing object near Earth’s surface.) On a roller coaster, you may experience brief accelerations up to 3g, which is (3)(9.8 m/s2), or about 29 m/s2, more than enough
to justify the cost of the ride.
Signs. In common language, the sign of an acceleration has a nonscientific
meaning: Positive acceleration means that the speed of an object is ­increasing, and
negative acceleration means that the speed is decreasing (the object is decelerat-
ing). In this book, however, the sign of an acceleration indicates a direction, not
whether an object’s speed is increasing or d­ ecreasing. For example, if a car with an initial velocity v = −25 m/s is braked to a stop in 5.0 s, then aavg = +5.0 m/s2. The ­acceleration is positive, but the car’s speed has decreased. The reason is the differ-
ence in signs: The direction of the acceleration is opposite that of the velocity.

Here then is the proper way to interpret the signs:
If the signs of the velocity and acceleration of a particle are the same, the speed of the particle increases. If the signs are opposite, the speed decreases.
Checkpoint 2.3.1
A wombat moves along an x axis. What is the sign of its acceleration if it is moving (a) in the positive direction with increasing speed, (b) in the positive direction with decreasing speed, (c) in the negative ­direction with increasing speed, and (d) in the negative ­direction with decreasing speed?

Sample Problem 2.3.1 Acceleration and dv/dt
A particle’s position on the x axis of Fig. 2.1.1 is given by x = 4 − 27t + t3,
with x in meters and t in seconds. (a) Because position x depends on time t, the particle must be moving. Find the particle’s velocity function v(t) and acceleration function a(t).
KEY IDEAS
(1) To get the velocity function v(t), we ­differentiate the position function x(t) with respect to time. (2) To get the

acceleration function a(t), we differentiate the velocity function v(t) with respect to time. Calculations:  Differentiating the position function, we find
v = −27 + 3t2,(Answer)
with v in meters per second. Differentiating the velocity function then gives us
a = +6t,(Answer)
with a in meters per second squared.

2.4  CONSTANT ACCELERATION

23

(b)  Is there ever a time when v = 0?

Calculation: Setting v(t) = 0 yields 0 = −27 + 3t2,
which has the solution

t = ±3 s.

(Answer)

Thus, the velocity is zero both 3 s before and 3 s after the clock reads 0.
(c)  Describe the particle’s motion for t ≥ 0.
Reasoning:  We need to examine the expressions for x(t), v(t), and a(t).
At t = 0, the particle is at x(0) = +4 m and is ­moving with a velocity of v(0) = −27 m/s—that is, in the negative ­direction of the x axis. Its acceleration is a(0) = 0 because just then the particle’s velocity is not changing (Fig. 2.3.2a).
For 0 < t < 3 s, the particle still has a negative v­ elocity, so it continues to move in the negative direction. However, its ­acceleration is no longer 0 but is i­ncreasing and positive. Because the signs of the velocity and the acceleration are ­opposite, the particle must be slowing (Fig. 2.3.2b).

Indeed, we already know that it stops momentarily
at t = 3 s. Just then the particle is as far to the left of the ­origin in Fig. 2.1.1 as it will ever get. Substituting t = 3 s into the ­expression for x(t), we find that the particle’s
position just then is x = −50 m (Fig. 2.3.2c). Its acceleration is still positive.
For t > 3 s, the particle moves to the right on the axis.
Its acceleration remains positive and grows ­progressively
larger in magnitude. The velocity is now positive, and it
too grows progressively larger in ­magnitude (Fig. 2.3.2d).

Key Idea 
● The following five equations describe the motion of a particle with constant acceleration:

v = v0 + at,

x − x0 = v0 t + ​ _12_  ​at2,

v2 = v20 + 2a(x − x0),

x − x0 = ​ _21_  ​(v0 + v)t,

x − x0 = vt − _​ 21_  ​at2.

These are not valid when the acceleration is not constant.

Constant Acceleration: A Special Case
­In many types of motion, the acceleration is either constant or approximately so.
For example, you might accelerate a car at an approximately constant rate when
a traffic light turns from red to green. Then graphs of your position, ­velocity,

and acceleration would resemble those in Fig. 2.4.1. (Note that a(t) in Fig. 2.4.1c is constant, which requires that v(t) in Fig. 2.4.1b have a constant slope.) Later when you brake the car to a stop, the acceleration (or deceleration in common ­language) might also be approximately constant.
Such cases are so common that a special set of equations has been derived for dealing with them. One approach to the derivation of these equations is given in this section. A second approach is given in the next section. Throughout both sections and later when you work on the homework problems, keep in mind that these equations are valid only for constant acceleration (or situations in which you can approximate the acceleration as being constant).
First Basic Equation.  When the acceleration is constant, the average acceleration and instantaneous acceleration are equal and we can write Eq. 2.3.1, with some changes in ­notation, as

As a check, note that this equation reduces to v = v0 for t = 0, as it must. As a further check, take the derivative of Eq. 2.4.1. Doing so yields dv/dt = a, which is the definition of a. Figure 2.4.1b shows a plot of Eq. 2.4.1, the v(t)
function; the function is linear and thus the plot is a straight line.
Second Basic Equation.  In a similar manner, we can rewrite Eq. 2.1.2
(with a few changes in nota­tion) as

and then as

​v​ avg​ = _​ xt_−−__​x_0_​ 0 ​​​  x = x0 + vavgt,(2.4.2)

in which x0 is the position of the particle at t = 0 and vavg is the average velocity between t = 0 and a later time t.
For the linear velocity function in Eq. 2.4.1, the average velocity over any time interval (say, from t = 0 to a later time t) is the average of the velocity at the beginning of the interval (= v0) and the velocity at the end of the interval (= v). For the interval from t = 0 to the later time t then, the average velocity is
​​v​ avg​ = ​ _12  ​(​ v​ 0​ + v)​ ​.​(2.4.3)

Substituting the right side of Eq. 2.4.1 for v yields, after a little rearrangement,

	​​​v​ avg​ = ​v​ 0​ + _​ 12  ​  at.​ Finally, substituting Eq. 2.4.4 into Eq. 2.4.2 yields

(2.4.4)

	​​x − ​x​ 0​ = ​v​ 0​  t + _​ 12  ​ at​ 2​.​	

(2.4.5)

As a check, note that putting t = 0 yields x = x0, as it must. As a further check, taking the derivative of Eq. 2.4.5 yields Eq. 2.4.1, again as it must. Figure 2.4.1a shows a plot of Eq. 2.4.5; the function is quadratic and thus the plot is curved.
Three Other Equations. Equations 2.4.1 and 2.4.5 are the basic equations for constant acceleration; they can be used to solve any constant acceleration p­ roblem

2.4  CONSTANT ACCELERATION

25

in this book. However, we can derive other equations that might prove useful in certain ­specific situations. First, note that as many as five quantities can possibly be ­involved in any problem about constant acceleration—namely, x − x0, v, t, a, and v0. Usually, one of these quantities is not involved in the problem, either as a given or as an unknown. We are then presented with three of the remaining quantities and asked to find the fourth.
Equations 2.4.1 and 2.4.5 each contain four of these quantities, but not the same four. In Eq. 2.4.1, the “missing ingredient” is the displacement x − x0. In Eq. 2.4.5, it is the velocity v. These two equations can also be combined in three ways to yield three additional equations, each of which involves a different “missing variable.” First, we can eliminate t to obtain

​​v​ 2​ = ​v​ 02​  + 2a​(​x − ​x​ 0​)​.​(2.4.6)

This equation is useful if we do not know t and are not required to find it. Second, we can eliminate the acceleration a between Eqs. 2.4.1 and 2.4.5 to produce an equation in which a does not appear:

	x​ − ​x​ 0​ = ​ _12  ​(​ v​ 0​ + v​)​t.​

(2.4.7)

Finally, we can eliminate v0, obtaining 	​​x − ​x​ 0​ = vt − ​ _12  ​ at​ 2​.​

(2.4.8)

Note the subtle difference between this equation and Eq. 2.4.5. One involves the initial velocity v0; the other involves the velocity v at time t.
Table 2.4.1 lists the basic constant-acceleration equations (Eqs. 2.4.1 and 2.4.5) as well as the specialized equations that we have derived. To solve a simple constantacceleration problem, you can usually use an equation from this list (if you have the list with you). Choose an equation for which the only unknown variable is the variable requested in the problem. A simpler plan is to remember only Eqs. 2.4.1 and 2.4.5, and then solve them as simultaneous equations whenever needed.

Checkpoint 2.4.1
The following equations give the position x(t) of a particle in four ­situations: (1) x = 3t − 4; (2) x = −5t3 + 4t2 + 6; (3) x = 2/t2 − 4/t; (4) x = 5t2 − 3. To which of these situa­ tions do the equations of Table 2.4.1 apply?

Sample Problem 2.4.1 Autonomous car passing slower car

In Fig. 2.4.2a, you are riding in a car controlled by an autonomous driving system and trail a slower car that you want to pass. Figure 2.4.2b shows the initial situation, with you in car B. Your system’s radar detects the speed and location of slow car A. Both cars have length L = 4.50 m, speed v0 = 22.0 m/s (49 mi/h, slower than the speed limit), and travel on a straight road with one lane in each direction. Your car initially trails A by distance 3.00L when you ask it to pass the slow car. That would require you to move into the other lane where there can be an oncoming vehicle. Your system must determine the time required for passing A, to see if passing would be

safe. So, the first step in the system’s control is to calcu-
late that passing time.
We want B to pull into the other lane, accelerate at a constant a = 3.50 m/s2 until it reaches a speed of v = 27.0 m/s (60 mi/h, the speed limit) and then, when it is at distance
3.00L ahead of A, pull back into the initial lane (it will then
maintain 27.0 m/s). Assume that the lane changing takes
negligible time. Figure 2.4.2c shows the situation at the
onset of the acceleration, with the rear of car B at xB1 = 0 and the rear of car A at xA1 = 4L. Figure 2.4.2d shows the situation when car B is about to pull back into the initial
lane. Let t1 and d1 be the time required for the acceleration

26

CHAPTER 2  Motion Along a Straight Line

and the distance traveled during the acceleration. Let t2 be the time from the end of the acceleration to when B
is ahead of A by 3L and ready to pull back. We want the
total time ttot = t1 + t2. Here are the pieces in the calculation. What are the values of (a) t1 and (b) d1? (c) In terms of L, v0, t1, and t2, what is the coordinate xB 2 of the rear of car B when B is ready to pull back? (d) In terms of L, v0, t1, and t2, what is the coordinate xA2 of the rear of car A just then? (e) What is xB2 in terms of xA2 and L? Putting the pieces together, find the values of (f) t2 and (g) ttot.

KEY IDEA

We can apply the equations of constant acceleration to both stages of passing: when car B has acceleration a = 3.50 m/s2 and when it travels at constant speed (thus, with constant a = 0).

Calculations:  (a) In the passing lane, B accelerates at the constant rate a = 3.50 m/s2 from initial speed v0 = 22.0 m/s to final speed v = 27.0 m/s. From Eq. 2.4.1, we find the time t1 required for the acceleration:

	​​t​ 1​ = ​ _v_−_a_ ​v__​ 0​ ​  = ​   _(2_7_._0_m__  3/_.s5_)0 _−​    _m_(/2_s_2  2​ ​  _.0__m_/_s_)​

= 1.4285 s ≈ 1.43 s.​

(Answer)

(b) In Eq. 2.4.6, let ​x − ​x​ 0​ be the distance d1 traveled by B during the acceleration. We can then write

	​​v​ 2​ = ​v​ 02​  + 2a​d1​  ​

	​ d1​  ​ = _​ ​v_​ 2​_2−a_  _​v_​ 02​ ​ ​  = ​   _(2_7_._0_ ​ _m  2_(/_  3s_).5_​2​0_− _​ m_(_2/  s_2  2​ _.​ 0)_  ​_m_​_/s_)_2​ ​

= 35.0 m​

(Answer)

(c) After the acceleration through displacement d1 from its initial position of xB1 = 0, the rear of car B moves at constant speed v for the unknown time t2. Its position is then

	​ ​x​ B2​ = ​d1​  ​ + v​t​ 2​.​

(Answer)

(d) From its initial position of xA1 = 4L, the rear of car A moves at constant speed v0 for the total time t1 + t2. Thus, its position is then

	​x​ ​ A2​ = 4L + ​v​ 0​  ( ​t​ 1​ + ​t​ 2​  ).​(Answer) (e) The rear of car B is then 3L from the front of A and thus 4L from the rear of A. So,

	​x​ ​ B2​ = ​x​ A2​ + 4L.​

2.4  CONSTANT ACCELERATION

27

Another Look at Constant Acceleration*
The first two equations in Table 2.4.1 are the basic equations from which the ­others are derived. Those two can be obtained by integration of the acceleration with the condition that a is constant. To find Eq. 2.4.1, we rewrite the definition of acceleration (Eq. 2.3.2) as

dv = a dt.

We next write the indefinite integral (or antiderivative) of both sides:

  ​   d​  v ​ = ​   a​  ​ dt.​

 

 

Since acceleration a is a constant, it can be taken outside the integration. We obtain

  ​   d​  v ​ = a​    d​ t​​

 

 

or

v = at + C.

(2.4.9)

To evaluate the constant of integration C, we let t = 0, at which time v = v0. ­Substituting these values into Eq. 2.4.9 (which must hold for all values of t,
­including t = 0) yields

v0 = (a)(0) + C = C.
Substituting this into Eq. 2.4.9 gives us Eq. 2.4.1. To derive Eq. 2.4.5, we rewrite the definition of velocity (Eq. 2.2.1) as

dx = v dt

and then take the indefinite integral of both sides to obtain

   ​  d​   x​​ = ​   v​  ​  dt.​

 

 

Next, we substitute for v with Eq. 2.4.1:

   ​  d​   x​= ​    (​ ​v​ 0​ + at​)​ dt.​

 

 

Since v0 is a constant, as is the acceleration a, this can be rewritten as

   ​   d​  x​ = ​v​ 0​    d​  t​  + a​   t​  ​  dt.​

 

 

 

Integration now yields

	​ x = ​v​ 0​t + ​ _12  ​  a​t​ 2​ + C′,​

(2.4.10)

where ​C′ ​ is another constant of integration. At time t = 0, we have x = x0. Substituting these values in Eq. 2.4.10 yields x0 =​C′ ​.  Replacing ​C​ ′ ​ with x0 in Eq. 2.4.10 gives us Eq. 2.4.5.

upward or downward) and if we can neglect the effects of air on its motion, the particle has a
Key Idea 
● An important example of straight-­line motion with constant acceleration is that of an object rising or falling freely near Earth’s surface. The constant-­ acceleration equations describe this motion, but we make two changes in notation: (1) We refer the

constant downward acceleration with a magnitude g that we take to be 9.8 m/s2. 2.5.2 Apply the constant-­acceleration equations (Table 2.4.1) to free-­fall motion.
motion to the vertical y axis with +y vertically up; (2) we replace a with −g, where g is the magnitude of the ­free-­fall acceleration. Near Earth’s surface,
g = 9.8 m/s2 = 32 ft/s2.

Free-­Fall Acceleration
If you tossed an object either up or down and could somehow eliminate the ­effects of air on its flight, you would find that the object accelerates downward at a certain constant rate. That rate is called the free-­fall acceleration, and its magnitude is represented by g. The acceleration is independent of the object’s characteristics, such as mass, density, or shape; it is the same for all objects.
Two examples of free-f­all acceleration are shown in Fig. 2.5.1, which is a series of stroboscopic photos of a feather and an apple. As these objects fall, they ­accelerate downward—both at the same rate g. Thus, their speeds increase at the same rate, and they fall together.
The value of g varies slightly with latitude and with elevation. At sea level in Earth’s midlatitudes the value is 9.8 m/s2 (or 32 ft/s2), which is what you should use as an exact number for the problems in this book unless otherwise noted.
The equations of motion in Table 2.4.1 for constant acceleration also apply to free fall near Earth’s surface; that is, they apply to an object in vertical flight, ­either up or down, when the effects of the air can be neglected. However, note that for free fall: (1) The directions of motion are now along a vertical y axis ­instead of the x axis, with the positive direction of y upward. (This is important for later chapters when combined horizontal and vertical motions are examined.) (2) The free-­fall acceleration is negative—that is, downward on the y axis, toward Earth’s center—and so it has the value −g in the equations.

Figure 2.5.1  A feather and an apple free fall in vacuum at the same ­magnitude of acceleration g. The ­acceleration increases the distance between successive images. In the absence of air, the feather and apple fall together.

The free-­fall acceleration near Earth’s surface is a = −g = −9.8 m/s2, and the ­magnitude of the acceleration is g = 9.8 m/s2. Do not substitute −9.8 m/s2 for g.
Suppose you toss a tomato directly upward with an initial (positive) velocity v0 and then catch it when it returns to the release level. During its free-­fall flight (from just after its release to just before it is caught), the equations of Table 2.4.1 apply to its motion. The acceleration is always a = −g = −9.8 m/s2, negative and thus downward. The velocity, however, changes, as indicated by Eqs. 2.4.1

and 2.4.6: During the ascent, the magnitude of the positive velocity decreases, ­until it momentarily becomes zero. Because the tomato has then stopped, it is at its maximum height. During the descent, the magnitude of the (now negative) velocity increases.

Checkpoint 2.5.1
(a) If you toss a ball straight up, what is the sign of the ball’s ­displacement for the ­ascent, from the release point to the highest point? (b) What is it for the descent, from the highest point back to the release point? (c) What is the ball’s ­acceleration at its highest point?

v = 0 at highest point

KEY IDEAS

(1) Once the ball leaves the pitcher and b­ efore it r­ eturns to his hand, its acceleration is the free-f­all acceleration a = −g. Because this is constant, Table 2.4.1 applies to the ­motion. (2) The velocity v at the maximum height must be 0.
Calculation: Knowing v, a, and the initial velocity v0 = 12 m/s, and seeking t, we solve Eq. 2.4.1, which contains those four variables. This yields

	​ t = _​ v_−_a_ ​v__​ 0​ ​  = ​ _0−_− 9__.81_ ​2_m_m_ / _s /2​ _s​ ​  = 1.2 s.​

(Answer)

(b) What is the ball’s maximum height above its release point?

Calculation: We can take the ball’s release point to be
y0 = 0. We can then write Eq. 2.4.6 in y notation, set y − y0 = y and v = 0 (at the maximum height), and solve for y. We get

	​ y = _​ ​v_​ 2​_2−_a  _​v_​ 02​ ​ ​  = ​   _02  _(−_−_9​(_​1._82  _ ​ m_m_ / /_ s s_2​)​ ​)_​2 ​​= 7.3 m.​

(Answer)

(c) How long does the ball take to reach a point 5.0 m above its release point?

Calculations: We know v0, a = −g, and displacement y − y0 = 5.0 m, and we want t, so we choose Eq. 2.4.5. Rewriting it for y and setting y0 = 0 give us

​y = ​v​ 0​  t − ​ _12  ​ ​gt​ 2​,​

Figure 2.5.2  A pitcher tosses a baseball straight up into the air. The equations of free fall ­apply for rising as well as for falling objects, provided any effects from the air can be ­neglected.

During ascent, a = –g, speed decreases, and velocity becomes less positive

During descent, a = –g, speed increases, and velocity becomes more negative
y = 0

or

​5.0 m = (​ ​12 m / s)​ ​t − (​ ​ _12  ​)​(9.8 ​ m / s2​ ​)​t​ 2​.​

If we temporarily omit the units (having noted that they are consistent), we can rewrite this as

4.9t2 − 12t + 5.0 = 0.

Solving this quadratic equation for t yields

t = 0.53 s  and  t = 1.9 s.

(Answer)

There are two such times! This is not really surprising
­because the ball passes twice through y = 5.0 m, once on the way up and once on the way down.

Graphical Integration in Motion Analysis

Integrating Acceleration.  When we have a graph of an object’s acceleration a ver-

sus time t, we can integrate on the graph to find the velocity at any given time.

The right side of the equation is a definite integral (it gives a numerical result
rather than a function), v0 is the velocity at time t0, and v1 is the velocity at later time t1. The definite integral can be evaluated from an a(t) graph, such as in Fig. 2.6.1a. In particular,

If a unit of acceleration is 1 m/s2 and a unit of time is 1 s, then the corresponding unit of area on the graph is

(1 m/s2)(1 s) = 1 m/s,

which is (properly) a unit of velocity. When the acceleration curve is above

the time axis, the area is positive; when the curve is below the time axis, the

area is negative.

If the unit of velocity is 1 m/s and the unit of time is 1 s, then the corre­ sponding unit of area on the graph is
(1 m/s)(1 s) = 1 m,
which is (properly) a unit of position and displacement. Whether this area is positive or negative is determined as described for the a(t) curve of Fig. 2.6.1a.

(a) To get the change in position function ∆ x from a graph of velocity v versus time t, do you graphically integrate the graph or find the slope of the graph? (b) Which do you do to get the acceleration?

Sample Problem 2.6.1 Graphical integration a versus t, whiplash injury

“Whiplash injury” commonly occurs in a rear-­end colli-

sion where a front car is hit from behind by a second car.

In the 1970s, researchers concluded that the injury was due

to the ­occupant’s head being whipped back over the top of

the seat as the car was slammed forward. As a result of this

finding, head restraints were built into cars, yet neck inju-

ries in rear-­end collisions continued to occur.

In a recent test to study neck injury in rear-e­nd col-

lisions, a volunteer was strapped to a seat that was then

moved abruptly to simulate a collision by a rear car mov-

ing at 10.5 km/h. F­ igure 2.6.2a gives the accelerations of

the volunteer’s torso and head during the collision, which

began at time t = 0. The torso acceleration was delayed by

40 ms because during that time interval the seat back had to

compress against the ­volunteer. The head acceleration was

delayed by an additional 70 ms. What was the torso speed

when the head began to ­accelerate?

FCP

KEY IDEA

We can calculate the torso speed at any time by finding an area on the torso a(t) graph.
Calculations:  We know that the initial torso speed is v0 = 0 at time t0 = 0, at the start of the “collision.” We want the torso speed v1 at time t1 = 110 ms, which is when the head begins to accelerate.

Combining Eqs. 2.6.1 and 2.6.2, we can write

	​​​v​ 1​ − ​v​ 0​ = (​ ​area  anbdettiwmeeena  xaics,cefrloermat   it​o​ 0​  ntocu ​t​ 1r​ v​e​​)​.​ (2.6.5)

For convenience, let us separate the area into three ­regions (Fig. 2.6.2b). From 0 to 40 ms, region A has no area:

areaA = 0.
From 40 ms to 100 ms, region B has the shape of a triangle, with area

​​area​ B​ = ​ _12  ​(​0.060 s)​ ​(50 ​ m / s2​ ​)​ = 1.5 m / s.​
From 100 ms to 110 ms, region C has the shape of a rectangle, with area
areaC = (0.010 s)(50 m/s2) = 0.50 m/s. Substituting these values and v0 = 0 into Eq. 2.6.5 gives us

v1 − 0 = 0 + 1.5 m/s + 0.50 m/s,

or

v1 = 2.0 m/s = 7.2 km/h.

(Answer)

Comments:  When the head is just starting to move forward, the torso a­ lready has a speed of 7.2 km/h. Researchers argue that it is this difference in speeds during the early stage of a rear-e­ nd collision that injures the neck. The backward whipping of the head happens later and could, especially if there is no head restraint, increase the injury.

CHAPTER 2  Motion Along a Straight Line

Review & Summary

Position  The position x of a particle on an x axis locates the particle with respect to the origin, or zero point, of the axis. The position is either positive or negative, according to which side of the origin the particle is on, or zero if the particle is at the origin. The positive direction on an axis is the ­direction of increasing positive numbers; the opposite direction is the negative ­direction on the axis.

Displacement  The displacement Δx of a particle is the change in its position:
Δx = x2 − x1.(2.1.1)
Displacement is a vector quantity. It is positive if the particle has moved in the positive direction of the x axis and negative if the particle has moved in the negative direction.

Average Velocity  When a particle has moved from position
x1 to position x2 during a time interval Δt = t2 − t1, its a­ verage velocity during that interval is

​v​ avg​ = ​ Δ_Δ_ x_ t  ​= ​ ​x_​t​ _2​ 2​​_−−__​x​t​ 1_​ 1​ ​​ .​

(2.1.2)

The algebraic sign of vavg indicates the direction of motion (vavg is a vector quantity). Average velocity does not depend on the actual distance a particle moves, but instead depends on its original and final positions.
On a graph of x versus t, the average velocity for a time interval Δt is the slope of the straight line connecting the points on the curve that represent the two ends of the ­interval.

Average Speed  The average speed savg of a particle dur-
ing a time interval Δt depends on the total distance the particle moves in that time interval:

	​​​s​ avg​ = ​ _  to_t_a_l_d_Δi  _st_  ta_n_c_e_  ​ .​

(2.1.3)

Instantaneous Velocity  The instantaneous velocity (or simply velocity) v of a moving particle is

​v = ​ Δlitm→0​ ​  Δ_Δ_x_t  ​ = _​ dd_xt_  ​,​(2.2.1)

where Δx and Δt are defined by Eq. 2.1.2. The instantaneous velocity (at a particular time) may be found as the slope (at that
particular time) of the graph of x versus t. Speed is the magni-
tude of instantaneous velocity.

Average Acceleration  Average acceleration is the ratio of a change in velocity Δv to the time interval Δt in which the change occurs:
​​a​ avg​ = ​ Δ_Δ_v_t  ​.​(2.3.1)
The algebraic sign indicates the direction of aavg.
Instantaneous Acceleration  Instantaneous acceleration (or simply acceleration) a is the first time derivative of velocity v(t) and the second time derivative of position x(t):

​a = ​ _dd_vt_  ​ = _​ ​d​d_​ 2t_​ ​ 2x_​ ​ .​

(2.3.2, 2.3.3)

On a graph of v versus t, the acceleration a at any time t is the slope of the curve at the point that represents t.

Constant Acceleration  The five equations in Table 2.4.1 describe the motion of a particle with constant acceleration:

v = v0 + at,(2.4.1)

	 	 ​​v​ x​ 2​ −= ​x​v​ 0​ 02​ ​  =+ ​v2​ 0a​  t​(​x+−​ _12  ​ a​xt​ 0​ 2​)​,​​,​

(2.4.5) (2.4.6)

	 	​ x​ x −− ​x​x​ 0​ 0​ ​ == _​ 12v  ​(t​v−​ 0​ +​ _12  ​ avt​)​ 2​t​.,​​

(2.4.7) (2.4.8)

These are not valid when the acceleration is not constant.

Free-­Fall Acceleration  An important example of straight-­ line motion with constant acceleration is that of an object r­ising or falling freely near Earth’s surface. The constant-acceleration equations describe this motion, but we make two changes in notation: (1) We refer the motion to the vertical y axis with +y vertically up; (2) we replace a with −g, where g is the magnitude of the free-­fall acceleration. Near Earth’s surface, g = 9.8 m/s2 (= 32 ft/s2).

6 E BIO The 1992 world speed record for a bicycle (human‑­ powered vehicle) was set by Chris Huber. His time through the measured 200 m stretch was a sizzling 6.509 s, at which he commented, “Cogito ergo zoom!” (I think, therefore I go fast!). In 2001, Sam Whittingham beat Huber’s record by 19.0 km/h. What was Whittingham’s time through the 200 m?

7 M Two trains, each having a speed of 30 km/h, are headed at each other on the same straight track. A bird that can fly 60 km/h flies off the front of one train when they are 60 km apart and heads directly for the other train. On reaching the other train, the (crazy) bird flies directly back to the first train, and so forth. What is the total distance the bird travels before the trains collide?

9 M BIO In 1 km races, runner 1 on track 1 (with time 2 min,
27.95 s) appears to be faster than runner 2 on track 2 (2 min,
28.15 s). However, length L2 of track 2 might be slightly greater than length L1 of track 1. How large can L2 − L1 be for us still to conclude that runner 1 is faster?

10 M FCP To set a speed record in a measured (straight-­line)
­distance d, a race car must be driven first in one direction (in
time t1) and then in the opposite direction (in time t2). (a) To eliminate the effects of the wind and obtain the car’s speed vc in a windless situation, should we find the average of d/t1 and d/t2 (method 1) or should we divide d by the average of t1 and t2? (b) What is the fractional difference in the two methods when a
steady wind blows along the car’s route and the ratio of the wind
speed vw to the car’s speed vc is 0.0240?

11 M GO You are to drive 300 km to an interview. The interview is at 11:15 a.m. You plan to drive at 100 km/h, so you leave at 8:00 a.m. to allow some extra time. You drive at that speed for the first 100 km, but then construction work forces you to slow to 40 km/h for 40 km. What would be the least speed needed for the rest of the trip to arrive in time for the interview?
12 H FCP Traffic shock wave. An abrupt slowdown in concentrated traffic can travel as a pulse, termed a shock wave, along the line of cars, either downstream (in the traffic direction) or upstream, or it can be stationary. Figure 2.10 shows a uniformly spaced line of cars moving at speed v = 25.0 m/s toward a uniformly spaced line of slow cars moving at speed vs = 5.00 m/s. Assume that each faster car adds length L = 12.0 m (car length plus buffer zone) to the line of slow cars when it joins the line, and assume it slows abruptly at the last instant. (a) For what separation distance d between the faster cars does the shock wave remain ­stationary? If the separation is twice that amount, what are the (b) speed and (c) direction (upstream or downstream) of the shock wave?

launch their spores by a catapult mechanism. As water condenses

from the air onto a spore that is attached to the mushroom, a drop grows on one side of the spore and a film grows on the other side. The spore is bent over by the drop’s weight, but when the film reaches the drop, the drop’s water suddenly spreads into the film and the spore springs upward so rapidly that it is slung off into the air. Typically, the spore reaches a speed of 1.6 m/s in a 5.0 μm launch; its speed is then reduced to zero in 1.0 mm by the air. Using those data and assuming constant accelerations, find the acceleration in terms of g during (a) the launch and (b) the speed reduction.

85  Fastball timing. In professional baseball, the pitching distance of 60 feet 6 inches is the distance from the front of the pitcher’s plate (or rubber) to the rear of the home plate. (a) Assuming that a 95 mi/h fastball travels that full distance horizontally, what is its flight time, which is the time a batter must judge if the ball is “hittable” and then swing the bat? (b) Research indicates that even an elite batter cannot track the ball for the full flight and yet many players have described seeing the ball−bat collision. One explanation is that the eyes track the ball in the early part of the flight and then undergo a ­predictive saccade in which they jump to an anticipated point later in the flight. A saccade suppresses vision for 20 ms. How far in feet does the fastball travel during that interval of no vision?

90  Braking, no reaction time. Modern cars with a computer system using radar can eliminate the normal reaction time for a driver to recognize an upcoming danger and apply the brakes. For example, the system can detect the sudden stopping of a car in front of a driver by using radar signals that travel at the speed of light. Rapid processing then can almost immediately activate the braking. For a car traveling at v = 31.3 m/s (70 mi/h) and assuming a normal reaction time of 0.750 s, find the reduction in a car’s stopping distance with such a computer system.
91  100 m dash. The running event known as the 100 m dash consists of three stages. In the first, the runner accelerates to the maximum speed, which usually occurs at the 50 m to 70 m mark. That speed is then maintained until the last 10 m, when the runner slows. Consider three parts of the record-s­etting run by Usain Bolt in the 2008 Olympics: (a) from 10 m to 20 m, elapsed time of 1.02 s, (b) from 50 m to 60 m, elapsed time of 0.82 s, and (c) from 90 m to 100 m, elapsed time of 0.90 s.

Let the car and motorcycle race in the positive direction of an x axis, starting with their midpoints at x = 0 at t = 0. At what (a) time and (b) position are their midpoints again aligned?

93  Speedy ants. The silver ants of the Sahara Desert are the fastest ants in terms of their body length, which averages 7.92 mm. In the hottest part of the day, they run as fast as 0.855 m/s. In terms of body lengths per second, how fast do they run? 94  Car lengths in trailing. When trailing a car on a highway, you are advised to maintain a trailing distance that is often quoted in terms of car lengths, such as in “stay back by 3 car lengths.” Suppose the other car suddenly stops (it hits, say, a large stationary truck). Assume a car length L is 4.50 m, your car speed v0 is 31.3 m/s (70 mi/h), your trailing distance is nL = 10.0L, and the acceleration magnitude at which your car can brake is 8.50 m/s2. What is your speed just before colliding with the other car if (a) your reaction time tr to start braking is 0.750 s and (b) automatic braking is immediately started by your car’s radar system that continuously monitors the road? What is the minimum value for n needed to avoid a collision with (c) the reaction time tr and (d) automatic braking? 95  Speed limits. (a) The greatest speed limit in the United States is along the tolled section of Texas State Highway 130 where the limit is 85 mi/h. How much time would be saved in driving that 41 mi section at the speed limit instead of 60 mi/h?

(b) The speed limit in residential areas is commonly 25 mi/h but some motorists drive at an average speed of 45 mi/h, perhaps by weaving through traffic and even driving through traffic lights that had just turned red. How much time would be saved in driving at that faster speed through 5.5 mi instead of the posted speed limit if the car does not stop at any intersections?
96  Autonomous car passing with following car. Figure 2.36a gives an overhead view of three cars with the same length L = 4.50 m. Cars A and B are moving at vA = 22.0 m/s (49 mi/h) along the right-hand lane of a long, straight road with two lanes in each direction, and car C is moving along the passing lane at vC = 27.0 m/s (60 mi/h) at initial distance d behind B. Car B is autonomous and is equipped with a computer control system using radar to detect the speeds and distances of the other two cars. At time t = 0, the front of car B is 3.00L behind the rear of car A, which is at xA1 = 0 on the x axis. We want B to pull into the passing lane, speed up and pass A, and then pull back into the right-hand lane, 3.00L in front of A and at the initial speed. The computer control system will allow 15.0 s for the maneuver and only if the front of C will be no closer than 3.00L behind A at the end of the maneuver, as in Fig. 2.36b. What is the least value of d that the system will allow?
97  Freeway entrance ramps. When freeways were first built in the United States in the 1950s, entrance ramps were often too short for an entering car to safely merge into existing traffic. Consider an aggressive car acceleration of a = 4.0 m/s2 and an initial car speed of v0 = 25 mi/h as the car enters the entrance ramp of a freeway where other cars are moving at 55 mi/h. (a) If the ramp has a length of d = 40 yd, what is the car’s speed v in miles per hour as it attempts to merge? (b) What is the minimum length d in yards needed for the car’s speed to match the speed of the other cars?
98  Autonomous car passing with oncoming car. Figure 2.37a gives an overhead view of three cars with the same length L = 4.50 m. Cars A and B are moving at vA = 22.0 m/s (49 mi/h) along a long, straight road with one lane in each direction and car C is oncoming at vC = 27.0 m/s (60 mi/h) at initial distance d in front of B. Car B is autonomous and is equipped with a computer and radar control system to detect the speeds and distances of the other two cars. At time t = 0, the front of car B is 3.00L behind the rear of car A, which is at xA1 = 0 on the x axis. We want B to pull into the other lane, speed up and pass A, and then pull back into the initial lane to be 3.00L in front of A and at the initial speed (Fig. 2.37b). The computer control system will allow 15.0 s for the maneuver but only if the front of C will be no closer than 10L in front of B at the end of the maneuver, as shown in the figure. What is the least value of d that the system will allow?

When Kitty O’Neil set the dragster records for the greatest speed and least elapsed time by reaching 392.54 mi/h in 3.72 s, what was her average acceleration in (a) meters per second squared and (b) g units? When Eli Beeding, Jr., reached 72.5 mi/h in 0.0400 s on a rocket sled, what was his average acceleration in (c) meters per second squared and (d) g units? For each person, assume the motion is in the positive direction of an x axis.
100  Travel to a star. How much time would be required for a starship to reach Proxima Centauri, the star closest to the Sun, at a distance of L = 4.244 light years (ly)? Assume that it starts from rest, maintains a comfortable acceleration magnitude of 1.000g for the first 0.0450 y and a deceleration (slowing) magnitude of 1.000g for the last 0.0450 y, and cruises at constant speed in between those periods.
101 CALC Bobsled acceleration. In the start of a four-­person bobsled race, two drivers (a pilot and a brakeman) are already on board while two pushers accelerate the sled along the ice by pushing against the ice with spiked shoes. After pushing for 50 m along a straight course, the pushers jump on board. The acceleration during the pushing largely determines the time to slide through the rest of the course and thus decides the winner with the least run time, which often depends on differences of 1.0 ms. Consider an x axis along the 50 m, with the origin at the start position. If the position x versus time t in the pushing phase is given by x = 0.3305t2 + 4.2060t (in meters and seconds), then at the end of a 9.000 s push what are (a) the speed and (b) the acceleration?
102  Car-­following stopping distance. When you drive behind another car, what is the minimum distance you should keep between the cars to avoid a rear-­end collision if the other car were to suddenly stop (it hits, say, a stationary truck)? Some ­drivers use a “2 second rule” while others use a “3 second rule.” To apply such rules, pick out an object such as a tree alongside the road. When the front car passes it, begin to count off seconds. For the first rule, you want to pass that object at a count of 2 s, and for the second rule, 3 s. For the 2 s rule, what is the resulting car−car separation at a speed of (a) 15.6 m/s (35 mi/h, slow) and (b) 31.3 m/s (70 mi/h, fast)? For the 3 s rule, what is the car−car separation at a speed of (c) 15.6 m/s and (d) 31.3 m/s? To check if the results give safe trailing distances, find the stopping distance required of you at those initial speeds. Assume that your car’s braking acceleration is –8.50 m/s2 and your reaction time to apply the brake upon seeing the danger is 0.750 s. What is your stopping distance at a speed of (e) 15.6 m/s and (f) 31.3 m/s? (g) For which is the 2 s rule adequate? (h) For which is the 3 s rule adequate?

103  Vehicle jerk indicating aggression. One common form of aggressive driving is for a trailing driver to repeat a pattern of accelerating suddenly to come close to the car in front and then braking suddenly to avoid a collision. One way to monitor such behavior, either remotely or with an onboard computer system, is to measure vehicle jerk, where jerk is the physics term for the time rate of change of an object’s acceleration along a straight path. Figure 2.38 is a graph of acceleration a versus time t in a typical situation for a car. Determine the jerk for each of the time periods: (a) gas pedal pushed down rapidly, 2.0 s interval, (b) gas pedal released, 1.5 s interval, (c) brake pedal pushed down rapidly, 1.5 s interval, (d) brake pedal released, 2.5 s interval.

104  Metal baseball bat danger. Wood bats are required in professional baseball but metal bats are sometimes allowed in youth and college baseball. One result is that the exit speed v of the baseball off a metal bat can be greater. In one set of measurements under the same circumstances, v = 50.98 m/s off a wood bat and v = 61.50 m/s off a metal bat. Consider a ball hit directly toward the pitcher. The regulation distance between pitcher and batter is ∆ x = 60 ft 6 in. For those measured speeds, how much time ∆ t does the ball take to reach the pitcher for (a) the wood bat and (b) the metal bat? (c) By what percentage would ∆t be reduced if professional baseball switched to metal bats? Because pitchers do not wear any protective equipment on face or body, the situation is already dangerous and the switch would add to that danger.
105  Falling wrench. A worker drops a wrench down the elevator shaft of a tall building. (a) Where is the wrench 1.5 s later? (b) How fast is the wrench falling just then?
106  Crash acceleration. A car crashes head on into a wall and stops, with the front collapsing by 0.500 m. The driver is firmly held to the seat by a seat belt and thus moves forward by 0.500 m during the crash. Assume that the acceleration is constant during the crash. What is the magnitude of the driver’s acceleration in g units if the initial speed of the car is (a) 35 mi/h and (b) 70 mi/h?
107  Billboard distraction. Highway billboards have long been a possible source of driver distraction, especially the modern

If you are traveling at 31.3 m/s (70 mi/h), how far along the road do you move if you look at a colorful and animated billboard for (a) 0.20 s (a glancing look), (b) 0.80 s, and (c) 2.0 s? Answer in both meters and in yards (to give you a feel for how your travel would be along an American football field).
108 BIO CALC Remote fall detection. Falling is a chronic danger to the elderly and people subject to seizure. Researchers search for ways to detect a fall remotely so that a caretaker can go to the victim quickly. One way is to use a computer system that analyzes the motions of someone on CCTV in real time. The system monitors the vertical velocity of someone and then calculates the vertical acceleration when that velocity changes. If the system detects a large negative (downward) acceleration followed by a briefer positive acceleration and accompanied by a sound burst for the onset of the positive acceleration, a signal is sent to a caretaker. Figure 2.39 gives an idealized graph of vertical velocity v versus time t as determined by the system: t1 = 1.0 s, t2 = 2.5 s, t3 = 3.0 s, t4 = 4.0 s, v1 = –7.0 m/s. (The plot on a more realistic graph would be curved.) What are (a) the acceleration during the descent and (b) the upward acceleration during the impact with the floor?

109  Ship speed in knots. Before modern instrumentation, a ship’s speed was measured with a line that had small knots tied along its length, separated by 47 feet 3 inches. The line was attached by three cords to a wood plate (a clip log) in the shape of a pie slice as shown in Fig. 2.40. One sailor threw the plate overboard and then allowed the force of the water against the plate to pull the line off a reel and through his hand so that he could detect the periodic passage of knots. Another sailor inverted a sandglass so that sand flowed from its upper chamber into the lower chamber in 28 s. During that interval the first sailor counted the number of knots passing through his hand. The result was the ship’s speed in knots (abbreviated as kn). If 17 knots passed, what was the ship’s speed in (a) knots, (b) miles per hour, and (c) kilometers per hour?

Key Ideas 
● Scalars, such as temperature, have magnitude only.
They are specified by a number with a unit (10°C) and obey the rules of arithmetic and ordinary algebra.
Vectors, such as displacement, have both magnitude
and ­direction (5 m, north) and obey the rules of vector
algebra. ● Two vectors →​​  a ​  and →​​ b ​  may be added geometrically by draw­ing them to a common scale and placing them
head to tail. The vector connecting the tail of the first to the head of the second is the vector sum →​​  s ​ ​. To t­shuebntraadctd→​​ b‒ ​ →​​ bfr ​ ​otom→​  a→​​  a ​ ​. ​ ​,Vreecvteorsr eadthdeitidoinreicstcioonmomf →​​ ubt ​ ​atotivgeeat n‒→ d​​ b ​ ​; obeys the associative law.

● The (scalar) components ax and ay of any two-­ dimensional vector →​​  a ​  along the coordinate axes are found by dropping perpendicular lines from the ends of →​​  a ​  onto the coordinate axes. The components are given by

ax = a cos θ  and  ay = a sin θ,

where θ is the angle between the positive direction of the x axis and the direction of →​​  a ​ ​. The algebraic sign of
a component indicates its direction along the associ-
ated axis. Given its components, we can find the magnitude and orientation of the vector →​​  a ​​  with

What Is Physics?
Physics deals with a great many quantities that have both size and direction, and it needs a special mathematical language—the language of vectors—to d­ escribe those quantities. This language is also used in engineering, the other ­sciences, and even in common speech. If you have ever given directions such as “Go five blocks down this street and then hang a left,” you have used the ­language of vectors. In fact, navigation of any sort is based on vectors, but physics and engineering also need vectors in special ways to explain phenomena involving rotation and magnetic forces, which we get to in later chapters. In this chapter, we focus on the ba­sic language of vectors.
Vectors and Scalars
A particle moving along a straight line can move in only two directions. We can take its motion to be positive in one of these directions and negative in the other. For a particle moving in three dimensions, however, a plus sign or minus sign is no longer enough to indicate a direction. Instead, we must use a vector.

3.1  Vectors and Their Components

45

A vector has magnitude as well as direction, and vectors follow certain ­(vector) rules of combination, which we examine in this chapter. A vector ­quantity is a quantity that has both a magnitude and a direction and thus can be represented with a vector. Some physical quantities that are vector quantities are displacement, velocity, and acceleration. You will see many more throughout this book, so learning the rules of vector combination now will help you greatly in later chapters.
Not all physical quantities involve a direction. Temperature, pressure, ­energy, mass, and time, for example, do not “point” in the spatial sense. We call such quantities scalars, and we deal with them by the rules of ordinary algebra. A single value, with a sign (as in a temperature of −40°F), specifies a scalar.
The simplest vector quantity is displacement, or change of position. A vector that represents a displacement is called, reasonably, a displacement vector. (Similarly, we have velocity vectors and acceleration vectors.) If a particle changes its position by moving from A to B in Fig. 3.1.1a, we say that it undergoes a displacement from A to B, which we represent with an arrow pointing from A to B. The arrow specifies the vector graphically. To distinguish vector symbols from other kinds of arrows in this book, we use the outline of a triangle as the arrowhead.
In Fig. 3.1.1a, the arrows from A to B, from Aʹ to Bʹ, and from Aʺ to Bʺ have the same magnitude and direction. Thus, they specify identical displacement vectors and represent the same change of position for the particle. A vector can be shifted without changing its value if its length and direction are not changed.
The displacement vector tells us nothing about the actual path that the particle takes. In Fig. 3.1.1b, for example, all three paths connecting points A and B correspond to the same displacement vector, that of Fig. 3.1.1a. Displacement vectors represent only the overall effect of the motion, not the motion itself.

Adding Vectors Geometrically

Suppose that, as in the vector diagram of Fig. 3.1.2a, a particle moves from A to

B and then later from B to C. We can represent its overall displacement (no

matter what its actual path) with two successive displacement vectors, AB and

BC. The net displacement of these two displacements is a single displacement

from A to C. We call AC the vector sum (or resultant) of the vectors AB and

BC. This sum is not the usual algebraic sum.

In Fig. 3.1.2b, we redraw the vectors of Fig. 3.1.2a and relabel them in the way

that we shall use from now on, namely, with an arrow over an italic symbol, as in →​  a ​ ​. If we want to indicate only the magnitude of the vector (a quantity that

B

lacks a sign or direction), we shall use the italic symbol, as in a, b, and s. (You

can use just a handwritten symbol.) A symbol with an overhead arrow always

implies both properties of a vector, magnitude and direction.

We can represent the relation among the three vectors in Fig. 3.1.2b with

As in the usual algebra, we can move a term that includes a vector symbol from

one side of a vector equation to the other, but we must change its sign. For example, if we are given Eq. 3.1.4 and need to solve for →​a   ​​,  we can ­rearrange the equation as

Remember that, although we have used displacement vectors here, the rules for addition and subtraction hold for vectors of all kinds, whether they represent velocities, accelerations, or any other vector quantity. However, we can add only vectors of the same kind. For example, we can add two displacements, or two ­velocities, but adding a displacement and a velocity makes no sense. In the arithmetic of scalars, that would be like trying to add 21 s and 12 m.

Checkpoint 3.1.1
The magnitudes of displacements →​  a ​  and →​ b ​  are 3 m and 4 m, ­respectively, and →​  c ​  = →​  a ​  + →​ b ​.  Considering various orientations of →​  a ​  and →​ b ​ , what are (a) the ­maximum possible magnitude for →​  c ​  and (b) the minimum possible magnitude?

Components of Vectors
Adding vectors geometrically can be tedious. A neater and easier technique ­involves algebra but requires that the vectors be placed on a rectangular coordinate system. The x and y axes are usually drawn in the plane of the page, as shown

3.1  Vectors and Their Components

47

in Fig. 3.1.7a. The z axis comes directly out of the page at the origin; we ignore it
for now and deal only with two-­dimensional vectors.
A component of a vector is the projection of the vector on an axis. In Fig. 3.1.7a, for example, ax is the component of vector →​a   ​​  on (or along) the x axis and ay is the component along the y axis. To find the projection of a vector along an axis, we draw perpendicular lines from the two ends of the vector to the axis,

This is the y component
of the vector.

as shown. The projection of a vector on an x axis is its x component, and similarly the projection on the y axis is the y component. The process of finding the ay

a

­components of a vector is called resolving the vector.

A component of a vector has the same direction (along an axis) as the ­vector. In Fig. 3.1.7, ax and ay are both positive because →​a   ​ ​extends in the positive direction of both axes. (Note the small arrowheads on the components, to indicate their direction.) If we were to reverse vector →​a   ​​,  then both components

would be negative and their arrowheads would point toward negative x and y.

In general, a vector has three components, although for the case of Fig. 3.1.7a

the component along the z axis is zero. As Figs. 3.1.7a and b show, if you shift

a vector without changing its direction, its components do not change. Finding the Components.  We can find the components of →​​a   ​​  in Fig. 3.1.7a

CHAPTER 3 Vectors

Sample Problem 3.1.1 Spelunking
For two decades spelunking teams crawled, climbed, and squirmed through 200 km of Mammoth Cave and the Flint Ridge cave system, seeking a connection. The team that finally found the connection “caved” for 12 hours to go from Austin Entrance in the Flint Ridge system to Echo River in Mammoth Cave (Fig. 3.1.9a), traveling a net 2.6 km westward, 3.9 km southward, and 25 m upward. That established the system as the longest cave system in the world. What were the magnitude and angle of the team’s displacement from start to finish?
KEY IDEA
We have the components of a three-d­imensional vector, and we need to find the vector’s magnitude and two angles to specify the vector’s direction.
Calculations: We first draw the components as in Fig. 3.1.9b. The horizontal components (2.6 km west and 3.9 km south) form the legs of a horizontal right triangle. The team’s horizontal displacement forms the hypotenuse of the triangle, and its magnitude dh is given by the Pythagorean theorem:
____________________
​dh​  ​ = ​√   (2.6​ km)2​ ​  +    (3.9 ​ km)2​ ​  = 4.69 km.​ Also from the horizontal triangle, we see that this horizontal displacement is directed south of due west (directly toward the west) by angle ​θh​ given by
​tan ​θh​  ​ = _ ​ 23..69 kkmm  ​,​

so

​θh​  ​ ​

=

​tan​−1​  _ 23..69 kkmm  ​ =

56°,​

which is one of the two angles we need to specify the

direction of the overall displacement.

To include the vertical component (25 m = 0.025 km),

we now take a side view of Fig 3.1.9b, looking northwest.

We get Fig. 3.1.9c, where the vertical component and the

horizontal displacement dh form the legs of another right triangle. Now the team’s overall displacement forms the

hypotenuse of that triangle, with a magnitude d:

______________________
	​ d = ​√   (4.69 ​ km  )2​ ​  +  (0.0  25​ km)2​ ​ 

= 4.69 km ≈ 4.7 km.​

(Answer)

This displacement is directed upward from the horizontal displacement by the angle

​	​​θv​  ​ ​

=

​tan−​ 1​  _ 04..06295kkmm ​  = 0.3°.​

(Answer)

Thus, the team’s displacement vector had a magnitude of

4.7 km and was at an angle of 56° south of west and at

an angle of 0.3° upward. The net vertical motion was, of

course, insignificant compared to the horizontal motion.

However, that fact would have been no comfort to the

team, which had to climb up and down countless times

to get through the cave. The route they actually covered

was quite different from the displacement vector, which

merely points in a straight line from start to finish.

Problem-­Solving Tactics Angles, trig functions, and inverse trig functions

Tactic 1: Angles—Degrees and Radians  Angles that
are measured relative to the positive direction of the x
axis are positive if they are measured in the counterclock-
wise direction and negative if measured clockwise. For
example, 210° and −150° are the same angle. Angles may be measured in degrees or radians (rad).
To ­relate the two measures, recall that a full circle is 360° and 2π rad. To convert, say, 40° to radians, write

Tactic 2: Trig Functions  You need to know the definitions of the common trigonometric functions—sine, cosine, and tangent—because they are part of the language of science and engineering. They are given in Fig. 3.1.10 in a form that does not depend on how the triangle is labeled.
You should also be able to sketch how the trig functions vary with angle, as in Fig. 3.1.11, in order to be able to judge whether a calculator result is reasonable. Even knowing the signs of the functions in the various quadrants can be of help.
Tactic 3: Inverse Trig Functions When the inverse trig functions sin−1, cos−1, and tan−1 are taken on a calculator, you must consider the reasonableness of the answer you get, b­ ecause there is usually another possible answer that the ­calculator does not give. The range of ­operation for a calculator in taking each inverse trig function is indicated in Fig. 3.1.11. As an example, sin−1 0.5 has associated angles of 30° (which is displayed by the calculator, since 30° falls within its range of operation) and 150°. To see both values, draw a horizontal line through 0.5 in Fig. 3.1.11a and note where it cuts the sine curve. How do you distinguish a correct answer? It is the one that seems more reasonable for the given situation.

Tactic 4: Measuring Vector Angles  The equations for cos θ and sin θ in Eq. 3.1.5 and for tan θ in Eq. 3.1.6 are valid only if the angle is measured from the ­positive direction of the x axis. If it is measured relative to some other direction, then the trig functions in Eq. 3.1.5 may have to be interchanged and the ratio in Eq. 3.1.6 may have to be ­inverted. A safer method is to convert the angle to one measured from the positive direction of the x axis. In WileyPLUS, the system expects you to report an angle of direction like this (and positive if counterclockwise and negative if clockwise).

3.2  UNIT VECTORS, ADDING VECTORS BY COMPONENTS

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
3.2.1 Convert a vector between magnitude-­angle and unit-­vector notations.
3.2.2 Add and subtract vectors in magnitude-­angle notation and in unit-­vector notation.

3.2.3 Identify that, for a given vector, rotating the coordinate system about the origin can change the vector’s components but not the vector itself.

Key Ideas 
● Unit vectors ​ˆi ​, ​ˆj ​, and ​​k̂ ​ have magnitudes of unity and are directed in the positive directions of the x, y, and z axes, respectively, in a right-­handed coordinate ­system. We can write a vector →​​  a ​  in terms of unit vectors as
→​  a ​  = ​a​ x ​​ˆi + ​a​ y​ˆ j​ + ​a​ z​k̂ ​ ,​

in which ax​​ i ​, ̂ ay​ˆj ​, and ​a​ z​k̂ ​ are the vector components of →​​  a ​  and ax, ay, and az are its scalar components.
● To add vectors in component form, we use the rules
rx = ax + bx  ry = ay + by  rz = az + bz.­ Here →​​  a ​  and →​​ b ​  are the vectors to be added, and →​​  r ​  is the vector sum. Note that we add components axis by axis.

The unit vectors point along axes.

Unit Vectors

A unit vector is a vector that has a magnitude of exactly 1 and points in a particular direction. It lacks both dimension and unit. Its sole purpose is to point—that is, to specify a direction. The unit vectors in the positive directions of the x, y, and z axes are labeled ​i  ​, ̂ ​ j ​,̂ and ​k̂ ,​​ where the hat ^ is used instead of an overhead arrow as for other vectors (Fig. 3.2.1). The arrangement of axes in Fig. 3.2.1 is said to be a right-­handed coordinate system. The system remains right-h­ anded if it is rotated rigidly. We use such coordinate systems exclusively in this book.

Unit vectors are very useful for expressing other vectors; for example, we can express →​  a ​  and →​ b ​  of Figs. 3.1.7 and 3.1.8 as

→​  a ​  = ​a​ x​ˆi ​ + ​a​ y​ˆj ​​(3.2.1)

and

→​ b ​  = ​bx​  ​ˆi ​ + ​by​  ​ˆj ​.​

(3.2.2)

These two equations are illustrated in Fig. 3.2.2. The quantities ax​ˆi ​ and ay​ˆj ​ are vectors, called the vector components of →​a   ​ ​. The quantities ax and ay are scalars, called the scalar components of →​a   ​ ​(or, as before, simply its ­components).

This is the y vector component.

Adding Vectors by Components
We can add vectors geometrically on a sketch or directly on a vector-c­ apable calculator. A third way is to combine their components axis by axis.

3.2  Unit Vectors, Adding Vectors by Components

51

To start, consider the statement

→​  r ​  = →​  a ​  + →​ b ​,  ​​

(3.2.3)

which says ­component

that the vector →​r​  ​ ​is the of →​  r ​ ​must be the same as

same as the vector (​→​a   ​  + →​ b ​ )​. the corresponding component

Thus, of ​(→​a   ​ 

+ea→​  bc ​ )h​:

rx = ax + bx(3.2.4)

ry = ay + by(3.2.5)

rz = az + bz.(3.2.6)

In other words, two are equal. Equations

(1) resolve the vectors into their scalar components; (2) combine these scalar components, axis by axis, to get the components of the sum →​r   ​ ​; and (3) combine the components of →​ r ​  to get →​  r ​ ​itself. We have a choice in step 3. We can express →​ r ​ 

in unit-­vector notation or in magnitude-­angle notation.

This procedure for adding vectors by components also applies to vector subtractions. Recall that a subtraction such as →​d​   ​ = →​  a ​  − →​ b ​​  can be rewritten as an ­addition →​ d ​ = →​  a ​  + (−→​ b ​ )​. To subtract, we add →​a   ​​  and ​−→​ b ​ ​by components, to get

dx = ax − bx,  dy = ay − by,  and  dz = az − bz,

where

Vectors and the Laws of Physics

So far, in every figure that includes a coordinate system, the x and y axes are parallel to the edges of the book page. Thus, when a vector →​a   ​​  is included, its com-

ponents ax and ay are also parallel to the edges (as in Fig. 3.2.3a). The only reason for that orientation of the axes is that it looks “proper”; there is no deeper reason. We could, instead, rotate the axes (but not the vector →​​a   ​​)  through an angle ϕ as

in Fig. 3.2.3b, in which case the components would have new v­ alues, call them ax′ and ay′. Since there are an infinite number of choices of ϕ, there are an infinite number of different pairs of components for →​a   ​. 

Which then is the “right” pair of components? The answer is that they are

all equally valid because each pair (with its axes) just gives us a different way of describing the same vector →​a   ​ ​; all produce the same magnitude and direction for

the vector. In Fig. 3.2.3 we have

______

________

​a = ​√ ​a​ x2​  + ​a​ y2​  = ​√ ​a​ x′ ​ 2​ + ​a​ y′ ​ 2​    ​(3.2.8)

and

θ = θ′ + ϕ.

(3.2.9)

The point is that we have great freedom in choosing a coordinate system, because the relations among vectors do not depend on the location of the origin or on the orientation of the axes. This is also true of the relations of physics; they are all independent of the choice of coordinate system. Add to that the simp­ licity and richness of the language of vectors and you can see why the laws of physics are almost always presented in that language: One equation, like Eq. 3.2.3, can represent three (or even more) relations, like Eqs. 3.2.4, 3.2.5, and 3.2.6.

where (2.6 m)iˆ is the vector component of →​​r   ​​  along the x axis and −(2.3 m)jˆ is that along the y axis. Figure 3.2.4b shows one way to arrange these vector components to form →​  r ​ ​. (Can you sketch the other way?)
We can also answer the question by giving the magnitude and an angle for →​r   ​​.  From Eq. 3.1.6, the magnitude is

Multiplying Vectors*
There are three ways in which vectors can be multiplied, but none is exactly like the usual algebraic multiplication. As you read this material, keep in mind that a vector-­capable calculator will help you multiply vectors only if you understand the basic rules of that multiplication.

Multiplying a Vector by a Scalar
If we multiply a vector →​a​   ​ ​by a scalar s, we get a new vector. Its magnitude is the product of the magnitude of →​​a   ​ ​and the absolute value of s. Its direction is the direction of →​​a   ​  if s is positive but the opposite direction if s is negative. To ­divide →​  a ​  by s, we multiply →​a   ​ ​by 1/s.

Multiplying a Vector by a Vector
There are two ways to multiply a vector by a vector: One way produces a scalar (called the scalar product), and the other produces a new vector (called the v­ ector product). (Students commonly confuse the two ways.)

angle There

are actually two such angles: ϕ and 360° ‒ ϕ. Either can be used in Eq. 3.3.1,

­because their cosines are the same.

*This material will not be employed until later (Chapter 7 for scalar products and Chapter 11 for vector products), and so your instructor may wish to postpone it.

CHAPTER 3 Vectors

Note that there are only scalars on the right side of Eq. 3.3.1 (including

the value of cos ϕ). Thus Because of the notation, →​a   ​ 

→ ⋅ ​ a→​ b ​  ⋅ ​​  i→​ sb ​a ​olsno

the left side represents a known as the dot product

scalar quantity. and is spoken as

“a dot b.”

A dot product can be regarded as the product of two quantities: (1) the magni-

tude of one of the vectors and (2) the scalar component of the second vector along

the direction of the first vector. For example, in Fig. 3.3.1b, →​  a ​​  has a scalar compo-

dropped from the scalar component

b cos ϕ along the direction of →​a   ​. 

If the angle ϕ between two vectors is 0°, the component of one vector along the other is maximum, and so also is the dot product of the vectors. If, instead, ϕ is 90°, the component of one vector along the other is zero, and so is the dot product.

Equation 3.3.1 can be rewritten as follows to emphasize the components:

→​  a ​ 

⋅

→
​  b ​ 

=

(a

cos

ϕ)(b)

=

(a)(b

cos

ϕ).​

(3.3.2)

The commutative law applies to a scalar product, so we can write

→​  a ​ 

⋅

→
​  b ​ 

=

→
​  b ​ 

⋅

→​  a ​.  ​

When two vectors are in unit-­vector notation, we write their dot product as

→​  a ​  ⋅ →​ b ​  = (​a​ x​ˆi ​ + ​a​ y​ˆ j​ + ​a​ z​k̂ ​) ⋅ (​bx​  ​ˆi ​ + ​by​  ​ˆj ​ + ​bz​  ​k̂ ​),​

(3.3.3)

which we can expand according to the distributive law: Each vector component of the first vector is to be dotted with each vector component of the second vector. By doing so, we can show that

→​  a ​  ⋅ →​ b ​  = ​a​ x​ bx​  ​ + ​a​ y​ by​  ​ + ​a​ z​ bz​  ​.​

	​​ →b ​  × →​  a ​  = − (→​  a ​  × →​ b ​ ).​	

(3.3.6)

In other words, the commutative law does not apply to a vector product. In unit-­vector notation, we write

→​  a ​  × →​ b ​  = ( ​a​ x​ˆ i​ + ​a​ y​ˆ j​ + ​a​ z​k̂ ​) × (​bx​   ​​ˆi + ​by​  ​ˆ j​ + ​bz​  ​k̂ ​),​

(3.3.7)

which can be expanded according to the distributive law; that is, each component of the first vector is to be crossed with each component of the second ­vector. The cross products of unit vectors are given in Appendix E (see “Products of Vectors”). For example, in the expansion of Eq. 3.3.7, we have

​a​ x​ˆ i​ × ​bx​  ​ˆ i​ = ​a​ x​ bx​  ​(​ˆi ​ × ​ˆ i) = 0,​
because the two unit vectors ​ˆi​ ​ and ​ˆi ​​are parallel and thus have a zero cross product. Similarly, we have

​a​ x​ˆi ​ × ​by​  ​ˆ j​ = ​a​ x​ by​  ​(​ˆ i​ × ​ˆj ) = ​a​ x​ by​  ​k̂ ​.​
In the last step we used Eq. 3.3.5 to evaluate the magnitude of ​ˆi​ ​ × ​ˆj ​ as unity. (These vectors ​ˆi​  and ​ˆj ​​each have a magnitude of unity, and the angle between them is 90°.) Also, we used the right-­hand rule to get the direction of ​ˆi​ ​ × ​ˆj ​ as ­being in the positive direction of the z axis (thus in the direction of ​k​ ̂ ​)  .

To check whether any xyz coordinate system is a right-­handed coordinate system, use the right-­hand rule for the cross product ​ˆ i​​ × ​ˆ j = ​k̂ ​​with that system. If your fingers sweep ˆi​​ ​​(positive direction of x) into ˆj​​ ​​(positive direction of y) with

Sample Problem 3.3.3 Cross product, unit‑vector notation

If →​  a ​  = 3​ˆ i − 4​ˆj ​ and →​ b ​  = − 2​ˆ i​ + 3​k̂ ​, what is →​  c ​  = →​  a ​  × →​ b ​ ?

KEY IDEA
When two vectors are in unit-­vector notation, we can find their cross product by using the distributive law.

→​  c ​  = (3​ˆi  − 4​ˆj  ​ ) × (−2​ˆi  + 3​k̂ ​)
= 3​ˆ i × (−2​ˆi  ​ ) + 3​ˆi  × 3​k̂ ​ + (−4​ˆj  ​ ) × (−2​ˆi  ​ )​ + (−4​ˆj ) × 3​k̂ ​.​

CHAPTER 3 Vectors

We next evaluate each term with Eq. 3.3.5, finding the ­direction with the right-­hand rule. For the first term here, the angle ϕ between the two vectors being crossed is 0. For the other terms, ϕ is 90°. We find

	​​ →c ​  = −6(0) + 9(−​ˆ j) + 8(−​k̂ ​)  − 12​ˆ i

= −12​ˆ i − 9​ˆ j − 8​k̂ ​.

In general: A cross product gives a perpendicular vec-

tor, two perpendicular vectors have a zero dot product, and

two vectors along the same axis have a zero cross product.

Review & Summary

Scalars and Vectors  Scalars, such as temperature, have magnitude only. They are specified by a number with a unit (10°C) and obey the rules of arithmetic and ordinary algebra. Vectors, such as displacement, have both magnitude and ­direction (5 m, north) and obey the rules of vector algebra.

Adding

Vectors

Geometrically  Two

vectors

→  ​ a ​  and

→
​  b ​ 

may be added geometrically by drawing them to a common

scale and placing them head to tail. The vector connecting the

tail of the first to the head of the second is the vector sum →​ s​ ​. To

­subtract

→
 ​b ​  from

→​  a​​ ,

reverse

the

direction

of

→
 ​ b ​ ​to

add ​−→  ​ b ​  to →​  a​ ​. Vector addition is commutative

get

→
​− ​  b ​ ;

then

	​​→​  a ​  + →​ b ​  = →​ b ​  + →​  a ​​​ 

(3.1.2)

and obeys the associative law 	​(→​  a ​  + →​ b ​ ) + →​  c ​  = →​  a ​  + (→​ b ​  + →​  c ​ ).​

(3.1.3)

Components of a Vector  The (scalar) components ax and ay of any two-­dimensional vector →​a​   ​ ​along the coordinate axes are found by dropping perpendicular lines from the ends of →​​a   ​  onto
the coordinate axes. The components are given by

ax = a cos θ  and  ay = a sin θ,(3.1.5)

where θ is the angle between the positive direction of the x axis and the direction of →​a​   ​​.  The algebraic sign of a compo-

nent indicates its direction along the associated axis. Given

its components, we can find the magnitude and orientation (direction) of the vector →​a   ​  by using

_
​a = ​√ ​a​ x2​ + ​a​ y2​ ​    and

tan θ = ​ _​a​a​ ​ yx​ ​ ​.​​

(3.1.6)

Unit-­Vector Notation  Unit vectors ​ˆi ​, ​ˆj ​, and ​k̂ ​ have magnitudes of unity and are directed in the positive directions of the x,
y, and z axes, respectively, in a right-­handed coordinate ­system
(as defined by the vector products of the unit vectors). We can write a vector →​  a ​ ​in terms of unit vectors as

	​​→​  a ​  = ​a​ x​ˆ i​ + ​a​ y ​​ˆj + ​a​ z​k̂ ​,​

(3.2.1)

in which ax​ˆi ​, ay​ˆj ​, and ​a​ z​k̂ ​ are the vector components of →​  a ​  and ax, ay, and az are its scalar components.

Adding Vectors in Component Form  To add vectors in component form, we use the rules
rx = ax + bx  ry = ay + by  rz = az + bz. (3.2.4 to 3.2.6) Here →​  a ​  and →​ b ​ ​are the vectors to be added, and →​ r ​ ​is the vector sum. Note that we add components axis by axis.We can then express the sum in unit-­vector notation or magnitude-­angle notation.
Product of a Scalar and a Vector  The product of a scalar s and a vector →​​v   ​​  is a new vector whose magnitude is sv and whose direction is the same as that of →​v   ​  if s is positive, and opposite that of →​v​   ​  if s is negative. (The negative sign reverses the vector.) To divide →​v   ​  by s, multiply →​  v ​ ​by 1/s.

in which ϕ is the angle between the directions of →​a   ​  and →​ b ​ . A scalar product is the product of the magnitude of one vector and the

scalar component of the second vector along the direction of the

first

vector.

which may be expanded according to the distributive law.

29 M FCP GO Typical backyard ants often create a network of chemical trails for guidance. Extending outward from the nest, a trail branches (bifurcates) repeatedly, with 60° between the branches. If a roaming ant chances upon a trail, it can tell the way to the nest at any branch point: If it is moving away from the nest, it has two choices of path requiring a small turn in its travel direction, either 30° leftward or 30° rightward. If it is moving toward the nest, it has only one such choice. ­Figure 3.9 shows a typical ant trail, with lettered straight sections of 2.0 cm length and symmetric bifurcation of 60°. Path v is parallel to the y axis. What are

the (a) magnitude and (b) angle (relative to the positive direction of the superimposed x axis) of an ant’s displacement from the nest (find it in the figure) if the ant enters the trail at point A? What are the (c) magnitude and (d) angle if it enters at point B?

Motion in Two and Three

Dimensions

4.1  POSITION AND DISPLACEMENT

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
4.1.1 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional position vectors for a particle, indicating the ­components along the axes of a coordinate system.
4.1.2 On a coordinate system, determine the direction and magnitude of a particle’s position vector from its components, and vice versa.

4.1.3 Apply the relationship between a particle’s displacement vector and its initial and final position vectors.

Key Ideas 
● The location of a particle relative to the origin of a coordinate system is given by a position vector →​r   ​ , which in unit-vector notation is
→​  r ​  = x ​ˆi + y​ˆ j + z​k̂  ​.​ Here ​xˆ​ i​,  ​yˆ​ j​,  and ​z​k̂  ​​are the vector components of position vector →​  r​ ​, and x, y, and z are its scalar components (as well as the coordinates of the particle).
● A position vector is described either by a magnitude and one or two angles for orientation, or by its vector or scalar components.

● If a particle moves so that its position vector changes from →​​  r 1​  ​ to →​​  r 2​  ​​, the particle’s displacement ​Δ→​  r ​  is
​Δ→​  r ​  = →​  r 2​  ​ − →​  r 1​  ​.​
The displacement can also be written as
	​ Δ→​  r ​  = (​x​ 2​ − ​x​ 1​)​ˆi ​ + (​y​ 2​ − ​y​ 1​) ​​ˆj + (​z​ 2​ − ​z​ 1​)​k̂ ​ = Δx​ˆi  + Δy​ˆj  + Δz​k̂  ​.​

What Is Physics?
In this chapter we continue looking at the aspect of physics that analyzes ­motion, but now the motion can be in two or three dimensions. For example, medical ­researchers and aeronautical engineers might concentrate on the physics of the two- and three-dimensional turns taken by fighter pilots in dogfights because a modern high-performance jet can take a tight turn so quickly that the pilot ­immediately loses consciousness. A sports engineer might focus on the physics of basketball. For example, in a free throw (where a player gets an uncontested shot at the basket from about 4.3 m), a player might employ the overhand push shot, in which the ball is pushed away from about shoulder height and then released. Or the player might use an underhand loop shot, in which the ball is brought u­ pward

Motion in three dimensions is not easy to understand. For example, you are probably good at driving a car along a freeway (one-dimensional motion) but would probably have a difficult time in landing an airplane on a runway (three-dimensional motion) without a lot of training.
In our study of two- and three-dimensional motion, we start with position and displacement.
Position and Displacement
One general way of locating a particle (or particle-like object) is with a position vector →​  r ​​,  which is a vector that extends from a reference point (usually the origin) to the particle. In the unit-vector notation of Module 3.2, →​​r   ​  can be written

z Figure 4.1.1  The position vector →​r   ​  for a particle is the vector sum of its vector components.

	​​ →r ​  = x​ˆi  + y​ˆ j + z​k̂  ​,​	

(4.1.1)

where ​x​ˆi ​, ​y​ˆj ​, and ​z​k̂  ​​are the vector components of →​r   ​ ​and the coefficients x, y, and z are its scalar components.
The coefficients x, y, and z give the particle’s location along the coordinate axes and relative to the origin; that is, the particle has the rectangular coordinates (x, y, z). For instance, Fig. 4.1.1 shows a particle with position vector
→​  r ​  = (−3 m)​ˆ i + (2 m)​ˆ j + (5 m)​k̂ ​

and rectangular coordinates (‒3 m, 2 m, 5 m). Along the x axis the particle is 3 m from the origin, in the ​− ​ˆi ​ direction. Along the y axis it is 2 m from the ­origin, in the ​+ ​ˆj ​ direction. Along the z axis it is 5 m from the origin, in the ​+ ​k̂ ​ ­direction.
As a particle moves, its position vector changes in such a way that the vector
always extends to the particle from the reference point (the origin). If the position vector changes—say, from →​​r   1​  ​ to →​  r 2​  ​​during a certain time interval—then the particle’s displacement ​Δ→​  r ​ ​during that time interval is

​Δ→​  r ​  = →​  r 2​  ​ − →​  r 1​  ​.​

(4.1.2)

Using the unit-vector notation of Eq. 4.1.1, we can rewrite this displacement as ​Δ→​  r ​  = (​x​ 2​ˆ i​ + ​y​ 2​ˆ j​ + ​z​ 2​k̂ ​  ) − (​x​ 1​ˆ i​ + ​y​ 1​ˆ j​ + ​z​ 1​k̂ ​)​

or as	​Δ→​  r ​  = (​x​ 2​ − ​x​ 1​)​ˆi ​ + (​y​ 2​ − ​y​ 1​)​ˆ j​ + (​z​ 2​ − ​z​ 1​)​k̂ ​,​	

(4.1.3)

where coordinates (x1, y1, z1) correspond to position vector →​r​   1​  ​ and coordinates (x2, y2, z2) correspond to position vector →​​r   2​  ​.​ We can also rewrite the displacement by substituting Δx for (x2 − x1), Δy for (y2 − y1), and Δz for (z2 − z1):
​Δ→​  r ​  = Δx​ˆ i + Δy​ˆj  + Δz​k̂  ​.​(4.1.4)

Sample Problem 4.1.1 Two‑dimensional position vector, rabbit run

A rabbit runs across a parking lot on which a set of ­coordinate axes has, strangely enough, been drawn. The coordinates (meters) of the rabbit’s position as functions of time t ­(seconds) are given by

x = ‒0.31t2 + 7.2t + 28

and

y = 0.22t2 ‒ 9.1t + 30.

(4.1.5) (4.1.6)

(a) At t = 15 s, what is the rabbit’s position vector →​​r   ​  in unit-vector notation and in magnitude-angle notation?

KEY IDEA

The x and y coordinates of the rabbit’s p­ osition, as given by Eqs. 4.1.5 and 4.1.6, are the scalar components of the rabbit’s position vector →​​r   ​ ​. Let’s evaluate those coordinates at the given time, and then we can use Eq. 3.1.6 to evaluate the magnitude and orientation of the position vector.

Calculations:  We can write

	​​ →r ​ (t) = x(t)​ˆ i ​ + y(t)​ˆj ​.​

(4.1.7)

(We write →​  r ​ (t)​ rather than →​  r ​ ​because the components are functions of t, and thus →​r   ​ ​is also.)

At t = 15 s, the scalar components are
x = (‒0.31)(15)2 + (7.2)(15) + 28 = 66 m and y = (0.22)(15)2 ‒ (9.1)(15) + 30 = ‒57 m,

so	​​ →r ​  = (66 m)​ˆi  − (57 m)​ˆj ​,​

(Answer)

which is drawn in Fig. 4.1.2a. To get the magnitude and angle of →​  r ​ ​, notice that the components form the legs of a

right triangle and r is the hypotenuse. So, we use Eq. 3.1.6:

4.2  AVERAGE VELOCITY AND INSTANTANEOUS VELOCITY

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
4.2.1 Identify that velocity is a vector quantity and thus has both magnitude and direction and also has components.
4.2.2 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional velocity vectors for a particle, indicating the components along the axes of the coordinate system.

4.2.3 In magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations, relate a particle’s initial and final position vectors, the time interval between those positions, and the particle’s average velocity vector.
4.2.4 Given a particle’s position vector as a function of time, determine its (instantaneous) velocity vector.

Key Ideas 
● If a particle undergoes a displacement ​Δ→​  r ​  in time interval Δt, its average velocity →​​  va ​  vg​ for that time interval is
→​  va ​  vg​ = _​ ΔΔ_→​ _rt_  ​  ​.​ ● As Δt is shrunk to 0, →​​  va ​  vg​ reaches a limit called either the velocity or the instantaneous velocity →​​  v ​​: 
→​  v ​  = ​ _dd_→​  rt_   ​  ​,​

which can be rewritten in unit-vector notation as
→​  v ​  = ​v​ x​ˆ i​ + ​v​ y​ˆ j​ + ​v​ z​k̂ ​,​
where vx = dx/dt, vy = dy/dt, and vz = dz/dt. ● The instantaneous velocity →​​  v ​  of a particle is always directed along the tangent to the particle’s path at the particle’s position.

Average Velocity and Instantaneous Velocity
If a particle moves from one point to another, we might need to know how fast it moves. Just as in Chapter 2, we can define two quantities that deal with “how fast”: average velocity and instantaneous velocity. However, here we must consider these quantities as vectors and use vector notation.
If a particle moves through a displacement ​Δ→​  r ​​  in a time interval Δt, then its average velocity →​  va ​  vg​ is
​average velocity = ​   _dt  i_ims_p_el_ai_cn  _et_em_r_ev_na_lt ​,​

or

→​  va ​  vg​ = _​ ΔΔ_→​ _rt_  ​  ​.​

(4.2.1)

This tells us that the direction of →​​v  a ​  vg​​(the vector on the left side of Eq. 4.2.1) must be the same as that of the displacement ​Δ→​  r ​ ​(the vector on the right side). Using Eq. 4.1.4, we can write Eq. 4.2.1 in vector components as

→​  va ​  vg​ = ​ _  Δ_x_​ˆi _+__Δ_Δ_y  t_​ˆj   _+__Δ_z_​k_̂  ​  ​ = _​ ΔΔ_x_t ​  ​ˆi  + _​ ΔΔ_y_t ​  ​ˆj  + _​ ΔΔ_z_t ​  ​k̂  ​.​

(4.2.2)

For example, if a particle moves through displacement (​ 12 m)​ˆi  + (3.0 m)​k̂ ​ in 2.0  s, then its average velocity during that move is

→​  va ​  vg​ = ​ _ΔΔ_→​ _rt_  ​  ​= ​ _  (1_2__m__)_​ˆi 2_+._0  _(s3_  ._0__m​ _)_​k_̂ ​  = (6.0 m / s)ˆi ​​ + (1.5 m / s)k​ ̂ ​.​

That is, the average velocity (a vector quantity) has a component of 6.0 m/s along the x axis and a component of 1.5 m/s along the z axis.
When we speak of the velocity of a particle, we usually mean the particle’s instantaneous velocity →​  v ​ ​at some instant. This →​v   ​​  is the value that →​v​  a ​  vg​ approaches

in the limit as we shrink the time interval Δt to 0 about that instant. Using the ­language of calculus, we may write →​v   ​ ​as the derivative

→​  v ​  = ​ _dd_→​  rt_   ​  ​.​	

(4.2.3)

Figure 4.2.1 shows the path of a particle that is restricted to the xy plane. As
the particle travels to the right along the curve, its position vector sweeps to the right. During time interval Δt, the position vector changes from →​​r   1​  ​ to →​  r 2​  ​ and the particle’s displacement is ​Δ→​  r ​ .
To find the instantaneous velocity of the particle at, say, instant t1 (when the particle is at position 1), we shrink interval Δt to 0 about t1. Three things happen as we do so. (1) Position vector →​​r   2​  ​ in Fig. 4.2.1 moves toward →​  r 1​  ​ so that ​Δ→​  r ​  shrinks toward zero. (2) The direction of ​Δ→​  r ​  / Δt​ (and thus of →​  va ​  vg​) approaches the ­direction of the line tangent to the particle’s path at position 1. (3) The average velocity →​  va ​  vg​ approaches the instantaneous velocity →​  v ​  at t1.
In the limit as Δt → 0, we have →​v​  a ​  vg​ → →​  v ​ ​and, most important here, →​v​  a ​  vg​ takes on the direction of the tangent line. Thus, →​v   ​​  has that direction as well:

The direction of the instantaneous velocity →​v   ​ ​of a particle is always tangent to the particle’s path at the particle’s position.

The result is the same in three dimensions: →​v   ​​  is always tangent to the particle’s path. To write Eq. 4.2.3 in unit-vector form, we substitute for →​  r ​  from Eq. 4.1.1: →​  v ​  = ​ _dd_t   ​(x​ˆi  + y​ˆ j + z​k̂  ​) = _​ dd_xt_ ​  ​ˆi  + _​ dd_yt_ ​  ​ˆ j + _​ dd_zt_ ​  ​k̂  ​.​
This equation can be simplified somewhat by writing it as

	​​ →v ​  = ​v​ x ​​ˆi + ​v​ y​ˆ j​ + ​v​ z​k̂ ​,​	 where the scalar components of →​v   ​  are

(4.2.4)

	​​v​ x​ = _​ dd_xt_  ​, ​v​ y​ = _​ dd_yt_  ​, and ​v​ z​ = ​ _dd_zt_  ​.​	

(4.2.5)

For example, dx/dt is the scalar component of →​​v   ​​  along the x axis. Thus, we can find the scalar components of →​v   ​ ​by differentiating the scalar components of →​r   ​ .
Figure 4.2.2 shows a velocity vector →​v   ​ ​and its scalar x and y components. Note that →​  v ​ ​is tangent to the particle’s path at the particle’s position. Caution: When a position vector is drawn, as in Fig. 4.2.1, it is an arrow that extends from one point (a “here”) to another point (a “there”). However, when a velocity vector

and in the direction the rabbit is running at t = 15 s.

KEY IDEA

We can find →​v   ​ ​by taking derivatives of the components of the rabbit’s position vector.

Calculations: Applying the vx part of Eq. 4.2.5 to Eq. 4.1.5, we find the x component of →​v   ​ ​to be

	​​v​ x​ = ​ _dd_xt_  ​= ​ _dd_t  ​ (−0.31​t​ 2​ + 7.2t + 28)​

= − 0.62t + 7.2.

(4.2.6)

At t = 15 s, this gives vx = ‒2.1 m /s. Similarly, applying the vy part of Eq. 4.2.5 to Eq. 4.1.6, we find

	​​v​ y​ = ​ _dd_yt_  ​= ​ _dd_t  ​ (0.22 ​t​ 2​ − 9.1t + 30) ​ = 0.44t − 9.1.

(4.2.7)

At t = 15 s, this gives vy = ‒2.5 m/s. Equation 4.2.4 then yields

4.3  AVERAGE ACCELERATION AND INSTANTANEOUS ACCELERATION

Learning Objectives 
After reading this module, you should be able to . . .
4.3.1 Identify that acceleration is a vector quantity and thus has both magnitude and direction and also has components.
4.3.2 Draw two-dimensional and three-dimensional acceleration vectors for a particle, indicating the components.

determine the average acceleration vector in ­magnitude-angle and unit-vector notations.
4.3.4 Given a particle’s velocity vector as a function of time, determine its (instantaneous) acceleration vector.
4.3.5 For each dimension of motion, apply the ­constant-acceleration equations (Chapter 2) to relate acceleration, velocity, position, and time.

Key Ideas 
● If a particle’s velocity changes from →​​  v ​ 1​ to →​​  v ​ 2​ in time interval Δt, its average acceleration during Δt is
→​  a ​ avg​ = → _​ ​  v_2 ​  _​Δ−_t_  →​ _v_1 ​  ​   ​= _​ ΔΔ_→​ _vt_  ​  ​.​
● As Δt is shrunk to 0, →​​  a ​ avg​ reaches a limiting value called either the acceleration or the instantaneous ­acceleration →​​  a ​ ​:

→​  a ​  = ​ _dd_→​  vt_  ​  ​.​ ● In unit-vector notation,
→​  a ​  = ​a​ x​ˆ i​ + ​a​ y​ˆj ​ + ​a​ z​k̂ ​,​ where ax = dvx/dt, ay = dvy/dt, and az = dvz/dt.

Average Acceleration and Instantaneous Acceleration
When a particle’s velocity changes from →​v​  1 ​  ​ to →​  v2 ​  ​​in a time interval Δt, its ­average acceleration →​  a ​ avg​ during Δt is

If we shrink Δt to zero about some instant, then in the limit →​a​  a ​  vg​ approaches the instantaneous acceleration (or acceleration)→​  a ​ ​at that instant; that is,

→​  a ​  = ​ _dd_→​  vt_  ​  ​.​

If the velocity changes in either magnitude or direction (or both), the particle must have an acceleration.

(4.3.4)

To find the scalar components of →​a   ​ ​, we differentiate the scalar components of →​v  ​ ​. Figure 4.3.1 shows an acceleration vector →​a​  ​ ​and its scalar components
for a particle moving in two dimensions. Caution: When an acceleration vec­tor is drawn, as in Fig. 4.3.1, it does not extend from one position to another. Rather, it shows the direction of acceleration for a particle located at its tail, and its length (representing the acceleration magnitude) can be drawn to any scale.

​a​ y​ = ​ _​dd_vt_y​  ​ ​= _​ dd_t  ​ (0.44t − 9.1) = 0.44 ​ m / s2​ ​.​

We see that the acceleration does not vary with time (it is a constant) because the time variable t does not appear in the expression for either acceleration component. Equation 4.3.3 then yields

→​  a ​  = (−​0.62 m / s2​ ​)​ˆ i​ + (​0.44 m / s2​ ​)​ˆj ​,​

(Answer)

which is superimposed on the rabbit’s path in Fig. 4.3.2. To get the magnitude and angle of →​a   ​ ​, either we use a

However, this angle, which is the one displayed on a calculator, indicates that →​a   ​​  is directed to the right and down-
ward in Fig. 4.3.2. Yet, we know from the components that →​  a ​ ​must be directed to the left and upward. To find
the other angle that has the same tangent as ‒35° but is not displayed on a calculator, we add 180°:

‒35° + 180° = 145°.

(Answer)

This is consistent with the components of →​a​   ​ ​because it gives a vector that is to the left and upward. Note that →​a   ​ 

has the same magnitude and direction throughout the

means that we could draw the very same vector at any other point along the rabbit’s path (just shift the vector to put its tail at some other point on the path without changing the length or orientation).
This has been the second sample problem in which we needed to take the derivative of a vector that is written in unit-vector notation. One common error is to neglect the unit vectors themselves, with a result of only a set of numbers and symbols. Keep in mind that a derivative of a vector is always another vector.

Figure 4.4.1  A stroboscopic photograph of a yellow tennis ball bouncing off a hard surface. Between impacts, the ball has projectile motion.

Projectile Motion

We next consider a special case of two-dimensional motion: A particle moves in a vertical plane with some initial velocity →​v​  0 ​  ​​but its acceleration is always the free-fall acceleration → ​ g​ ​, which is downward. Such a particle is called a projectile

(meaning that it is projected or launched), and its motion is called projectile

­motion. A projectile might be a tennis ball (Fig. 4.4.1) or baseball in flight, but

it is not a duck in flight. Many sports involve the study of the projectile motion

of a ball. For example, the racquetball player who discovered the Z-shot in the

1970s easily won his games because of the ball’s perplexing flight to the rear of

the court.

FCP

Our goal here is to analyze projectile motion using the tools for two-­

dimensional motion described in Modules 4.1 through 4.3 and making the

­assumption that air has no effect on the projectile. Figure 4.4.2, which we

shall analyze soon, shows the path followed by a projectile when the air has no ­effect. The projectile is launched with an initial velocity →​v​  0 ​  ​ that can be written as

	​​​ →v0 ​  ​ = ​v​ 0x​ˆ i​ + ​v​ 0y​ˆj ​.​

(4.4.1)

The components v0x and v0y can then be found if we know the angle θ0 between →​  v0 ​  ​ and the positive x direction:

v0x = v0 cos θ0  and  v0y = v0 sin θ0.(4.4.2)
During its two-dimensional motion, the projectile’s position vector →​r​  ​  and ­velocity vector → ​ v ​​  change continuously, but its acceleration vector →​a​   ​  is constant and ­always directed vertically downward. The projectile has no horizontal ­acceleration.
Projectile motion, like that in Figs. 4.4.1 and 4.4.2, looks complicated, but we have the following simplifying feature (known from experiment):

In projectile motion, the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent of each other; that is, neither motion affects the other.
This feature allows us to break up a problem involving two-dimensional motion into two separate and easier one-dimensional problems, one for the horizontal motion (with zero acceleration) and one for the vertical motion (with constant downward acceleration). Here are two experiments that show that the horizontal motion and the vertical motion are independent.

Figure 4.4.3 is a stroboscopic photograph of two golf balls, one simply released and the other shot horizontally by a spring. The golf balls have the same vertical motion, both falling through the same vertical distance in the same interval of time. The fact that one ball is moving horizontally while it is falling has no effect on its vertical motion; that is, the horizontal and vertical motions are independent of each other.
A Great Student Rouser
In Fig. 4.4.4, a blowgun G using a ball as a projectile is aimed directly at a can suspended from a magnet M. Just as the ball leaves the blowgun, the can is released. If g (the magnitude of the free-fall acceleration) were zero, the ball would follow the straight-line path shown in Fig. 4.4.4 and the can would float in place after the magnet released it. The ball would certainly hit the can. However, g is not zero, but the ball still hits the can! As Fig. 4.4.4 shows, ­during the time of flight of the ball, both ball and can fall the same distance h from their zero-g locations. The harder the demonstrator blows, the greater is the ball’s initial speed, the shorter the flight time, and the smaller the value of h.
Checkpoint 4.4.1
At a certain instant, a fly ball has velocity →​v   ​  = 25​ˆ i − 4.9​ˆj ​ (the x axis is horizontal, the y axis is upward, and →​v   ​ ​is in meters per second). Has the ball passed its highest point?

The ball and the can fall the same distance h.

The Horizontal Motion

Now we are ready to analyze projectile motion, horizontally and vertically. We
start with the horizontal motion. Because there is no acceleration in the hori-
zontal direction, the horizontal c­ omponent vx of the projectile’s velocity remains unchanged from its initial value v0x throughout the motion, as demonstrated in Fig. 4.4.5. At any time t, the projectile’s horizontal displacement x ‒ x0 from an initial position x0 is given by Eq. 2.4.5 with a = 0, which we write as

x ‒ x0 = v0xt.

Because v0x = v0 cos θ0, this becomes

x ‒ x0 = (v0 cos θ0)t.

(4.4.3)

Figure 4.4.4  The projectile ball ­always hits the falling can. Each falls a distance h from where it would be were there no free-fall acceleration.

The Vertical Motion

The vertical motion is the motion we discussed in Module 2.5 for a particle in free
fall. Most important is that the acceleration is constant. Thus, the equations of
Table 2.4.1 apply, provided we substitute ‒g for a and switch to y notation. Then, for example, Eq. 2.4.5 becomes

	​ y − ​y​ 0​ = ​v​ 0y​t − _​ 12  ​ gt​ 2​ ​= (​v​ 0​ sin ​θ0​  ​)t − _​ 12  ​ gt​ 2​,​(4.4.4)
where the initial vertical velocity component v0y is replaced with the equivalent v0 sin θ0. Similarly, Eqs. 2.4.1 and 2.4.6 become

vy = v0 sin θ0 ‒ gt(4.4.5)

and

​v​ y2​  = (​v​ 0​  sin ​θ0​  ​)2​ ​ − 2g(y − ​y​ 0​).​(4.4.6)

As is illustrated in Fig. 4.4.2 and Eq. 4.4.5, the vertical velocity component behaves just as for a ball thrown vertically upward. It is directed upward initially, and its magnitude steadily decreases to zero, which marks the maximum height of the path. The vertical velocity component then reverses direction, and its magnitude becomes larger with time.
