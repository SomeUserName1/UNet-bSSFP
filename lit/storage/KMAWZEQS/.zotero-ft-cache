Summary

The process by which the protons release the energy that they absorbed from the RF pulse is known as relaxation. Relaxation is a fundamental aspect of MR, as essential as energy absorption, and provides the primary mechanism for image contrast. In resonance absorption, RF energy is absorbed by the protons only when it is broadcast at the correct frequency. Following excitation, relaxation occurs in which the protons release this added energy and return to their original configuration through naturally occurring processes. Two relaxation times can be measured, known as T1 and T2. While both times measure the spontaneous energy transfer by an excited proton, they differ in the final disposition of the energy. The rate of RF pulse application and the efficiency of energy transfer must have the proper balance. Spin-lattice relaxation measures the rate of energy transfer from an excited proton to its surroundings.
