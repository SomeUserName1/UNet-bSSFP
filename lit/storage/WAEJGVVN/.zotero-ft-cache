Fundamentals of Balanced Steady State Free Precession MRI
Oliver Bieri, PhD1, and Klaus Scheffler, PhD2,3*

Balanced steady state free precession (balanced SSFP) has become increasingly popular for research and clinical applications, offering a very high signal-to-noise ratio and a T2/T1-weighted image contrast. This review article gives an overview on the basic principles of this fast imaging technique as well as possibilities for contrast modiﬁcation. The ﬁrst part focuses on the fundamental principles of balanced SSFP signal formation in the transient phase and in the steady state. In the second part, balanced SSFP imaging, contrast, and basic mechanisms for contrast modiﬁcation are revisited and contemporary clinical applications are discussed. J. Magn. Reson.

SINCE ITS INTRODUCTION more than half a century ago, the use of steady state free precession (SSFP) has become increasingly popular, and a huge number of SSFP imaging methods have been described so far (e.g., see Handbook of MRI Pulse Sequences) (1). In general, the term “SSFP” imbeds all steady state sequences and variants thereof, because it just denotes the most basic SSFP principle, as introduced in 1958 by Carr (2): a fast train of radiofrequency (RF) pulses interleaved by periods of so-called “free precession,” indicating the absence of a driving RF excitation ﬁeld. As a result, all rapid gradient echo sequences (with TR ( T2 T1) are SSFP sequences, but different steady states may be established by different gradient switching patterns (applied within the free precession period, relating to the amount of spin dephasing within TR), or as a function of the RF pulse phase changes, or both.

The most important basic types of SSFP sequences are: the RF spoiled SSFP (with acronyms FLASH, SPGR, T1-FFE), the gradient dephased, i.e., nonbalanced, SSFP-FID (FISP, GRASS, FFE), its time reversed version, the gradient spoiled, i.e., nonbalanced, SSFP-Echo (PSIF, T2-FFE), and ﬁnally, the balanced SSFP (TrueFISP, FIESTA, balanced FFE) sequence. This article is dedicated to a review of the theory and imaging sequences of balanced SSFP. Signal formation in balanced SSFP will be traced following the multi-pulse approach, as historically introduced by Carr (2), and the basic principles and signal properties of balanced SSFP will be revisited for the transient phase and in the steady state. After elucidation of the underlying theoretical principles, imaging with balanced SSFP will be described and possibilities to modify the generic contrast will be presented, followed by a short overview on contemporary balanced SSFP imaging applications.
THEORY OF SIGNAL FORMATION IN BALANCED SSFP
Carr’s work and experimental approach to steady state free precession is in the context of this review on balanced SSFP not only of fundamental historical relevance but also offers a highly valuable concept to understand the most basic principles of signal formation in SSFP. As a result, we will, from a presentday perspective, tread a rather unconventional way in the description of SSFP and follow the mathematical analysis of SSFP experiments, as presented by Carr (2).
For the description of spin dynamics, we make use of the matrix representation theory of spin dynamics proposed by Jaynes in 1954 (3) and follow the formal mathematical treatment of multi-pulse experiments, as introduced by Woessner in 1961 (4). In general, the duration (TRF) of the excitation pulses is assumed to be short as compared to the overall relaxation processes (T1,2) to separate the Bloch equations (5) into repetitive basic units of RF pulses and interpulse delays. Overall, this leads to piece-wise constant Bloch equations that can be explicitly solved and successively applied. If not otherwise stated, the signal of balanced SSFP will be analyzed at TE ¼ TR/2.

Figure 1. Train of equally spaced (TR), phase coherent (here: constant), RF excitation pulses (shown as black bars) with ﬂip angle a, interleaved by periods of free precession (cf. Fig. 2 by Carr) (2). For reasons of simplicity, quasi-instantaneous RF pulses are assumed (i.e., TRF $ 0). At time t < 0, the magnetization M is presumed to be in thermal equilibrium (M0). The magnetization is allowed to accumulate a constant precession angle (f) during TR, i.e., due to static variations in the main magnetic ﬁeld (f $ gDB0t). The magnetization immediately preceding (proceeding) the RF pulse is labeled with a superﬁx “À” (“þ”): MxyÀ (Mxyþ).

Within the boundary condition of TR ( T2 T1, the quick succession of RF pulses hinders the magnetization from returning to the thermal equilibrium state M0 and each RF pulse acts, therefore, on both the remaining transversal and the remaining longitudinal magnetization. The magnetization in such a multipulse experiment is thus a mixture or superposition of different transversal and longitudinal states and results in beautiful but rather complex patterns even after a few RF pulses (see Fig. 2) but approaches after sufﬁcient repetitions a steady state or sometimes called “dynamic equilibrium” (meaning that the properties of the magnetization is unchanging with time). In the following, we will trace the time evolution of the spin magnetization in such a multi-pulse experiment and analyze the signal behavior in the transient, as well as in the steady state.
Time Evolution of Magnetization

A Fast Train of RF Pulses
The standard scheme of a steady state free precession experiment is shown in Figure 1 (cf. Fig. 2 in Carr’s article) and is given by a series of equally spaced (TR), phase coherent, and quasi-instantaneous RF pulses with ﬂip angle a. In general, the magnetization is allowed to accumulate a constant phase advance (f) within any TR, due to ﬁeld inhomogeneities, local susceptibility gradients or chemical shift effects.

For the multi-pulse experiment shown in Figure 1, the magnetization approaches by itself a steady state after sufﬁcient TR periods (see also Fig. 2). In Figure 3, the time evolution of the magnetization is shown as a function of the off-resonance related precession angle: for f ¼ 0 (on-resonant case) and for f ¼ 90 and f ¼ 180 (covering the relevant range of off-resonances) (simulation parameters are given in the Figure caption). It can be observed, that independently of the off-resonance related precession angle, the

Time evolution of the magnetization in a multi-pulse experiment as shown in Figure 1 at TE ¼ TR/2 for the ﬁrst few TR periods and after a few hundred TR periods and as a function of the offresonance related precession in the interval f ¼ [À180 , 180 ] (black line: tip of magnetization vectors; black circle: f ¼ 0 ; gray circle: f ¼ 90 ; white circle: f ¼ 180 ). Note that the magnetization is shown at TE ¼ TR / 2 and thus only reveals a phase advance of f/2 (e.g., see TR(1)). After sufﬁcient waiting time, a steady state in the magnetization is attained, suggesting that the conﬁguration of the magnetization in space is unchanging from TR to TR. Simulation parameters: TR/T2/ T1 ¼ 10 ms / 100 ms / 200 ms; a ¼ 90 .

tially proposed by Hargreaves et al (6). Analytical sol-

utions to the transient response of SSFP were ﬁrst

derived by Schefﬂer (7) and have been further adapted

to include off-resonance effects by Ganter (8). As

noted by Hargreaves et al (6), there are always one

real and two complex conjugate eigenvectors that

determine the transient response. Using perturbation

theory, Ganter (8) demonstrated that in leading order,

the complex conjugate eigenvectors are perpendicular

to the real one which is parallel to the steady state

magnetization (Mss). The real eigenvalue (associated with the real eigenvector) deﬁnes a relaxation rate (cf.

Eq. [11] in Ganter (8)) parallel to Mss, given by:

magnetization approaches after some transient phase a steady state, i.e., a stationary value in the amplitude. The magnetization does not evolve to the same stationary value, but the steady state magnetization (Mss) shows a strong modulation as a function of the off-resonance (Mss,xy(f¼0 ) $ 0.025, Mss,xy(f ¼ 90 ) $ 0.283, Mss,xy(f ¼ 180 ) $ 0.333; it is of some interest here to point out that the maximum steady state signal is not achieved at on-resonance, but with f ¼ 180 ; this peculiarity has direct practical implications, as explained later, cf. “Imaging with Balanced Steady State Free Precession”). Similarly, the transient phase (sometimes also referred to as “transient response” or “transient state”) is affected from off-resonance but shows in addition a strong oscillatory behavior. Because overall the magnetization is a mixture or superposition of different transversal and longitudinal states (see Fig. 2), the measured signal from fast imaging sequences will generally depend not only on the off-resonance related precession angle (f) but will also be a function of intrinsic tissue properties, such as relaxation (T1,2), as well as of extrinsic sequence related parameters, such as the repetition time (TR), the echo time (TE), and the ﬂip angle (a).
The Transient State
The time evolution of the magnetization in the transient phase of SSFP can be mathematically analyzed based on the matrix representations given by Jaynes

The expression given in Eq. (1) converges to the results found by Schefﬂer (cf. Eq. (7) in Ref. (7)) for f ¼ 180 .
It is found that the relaxation rate of both components depends not only on the ﬂip angle (a) and on the relaxation rates (R1,2) but also on the off-resonance related precession angle (f). The transient component in the magnetization parallel to the steady state magnetization (Mss) shows a smooth decay, whereas the perpendicular components causes the oscillatory behavior in the transient phase (see Fig. 3).
In general, the transition to steady-state from thermal equilibrium is completed after 5ÁT1. However, this often is not an acceptable waiting time for a rapid imaging method and typically signal acquisition starts within the transient phase. Imaging in the transient phase, however, due to the oscillatory behavior of the perpendicular components (see Fig. 3) is prone to generate artifacts. As a result, several preparation methods have been proposed to facilitate, enhance, or smooth this transition. The transition to steady state is shown in Figure 4 for the frequently used single (a/ 2 – TR/2) preparation proposed by Deimling and Heid (9) and a simple saturation recovery, i.e., starting balanced SSFP (bSSFP) after a 90 degrees pulse and spoiler gradient. With the (a/2 – TR/2) preparation, the magnetization is initially brought very near to the ﬁnal steady state. In general, saturation recovery shows a smooth transition over the complete range of off-resonances, whereas residual signal oscillations

whereas the signal regions close to zero are associated with a “stop-band,” i.e., signal voids (having a width of approximately 1/3, i.e., 120 of the periodicity of the frequency response). In general, it is observed that the steady state amplitude decreases with decreasing T2/T1 (Fig. 5a) and that the optimum ﬂip angle (yielding maximum steady state amplitude) decreases with decreasing T2/T1 (Fig. 5b). Of interest, the maximum signal for some given T2/T1 can be preserved but is shifted toward the stop-band for ﬂip angles a < aopt (see Fig. 5c). This is in contrast to the signal that can be achieved with ﬂip angles a > aopt (Fig. 5d) leading to an overall decrease in the steady state signal over the complete range of off-resonance related precession angles.
The steady state amplitude (i.e., the transverse magnetization component) immediately after the RF pulse as a function of TR, TE, the ﬂip angle a, relaxation times T1,2, and off-resonances (f) is given by (see Refs. (14–16)).

can still be present with the (a/2 – TR/2) preparation approach. As a result, more sophisticated solutions have been proposed and developed to accelerate the transition toward the steady state (6,9–13), or to modify its contrast behavior (cf. the Possibilities to Modify the BSSFP Contrast section).
The Steady State
The signal properties in the steady state were already described by Carr (cf. Eq. [10] in Ref (2)) assuming T2 ¼ T1 and subsequently further developed to the more general case of T2 < T1 by Ernst and Anderson in 1966 (14) and Freeman and Hill in 1971 (15) and many others (16–22). Similar to what is observed in the transient state, the steady state shows not only a prominent sensitivity to off-resonances (Fig. 5a; see also Fig. 3), but shows also a strong dependence on the ﬂip angle (Fig. 5b) and on the relaxation time ratio T2/T1 (see Figs. 5a and 5b). Off-resonances (see Fig. 5a) lead to a pronounced and periodic modulation in the steady state amplitude frequently referred to as the “frequency response” of balanced SSFP. The high signal regions are commonly referred to as “passband” regions (61/(3TR), having a width of approximately 2/(3TR), i.e., 240 , see Schefﬂer et al) (23),

The distribution of the magnetization components in steady state are shown in Figure 6a for Mþ (i.e., for t ! 0; see Eq. (4)), for t ¼ TR/2, that is for a centered echo, and for MÀ (i.e., for t ! TR). Because the steady state signal drops close to zero for pixels with off-resonance frequencies relating to a phase advance close to f ¼ 6 nÁ360 (n ʦ N0), giving rise to dark bands or “banding artifacts” in images (see Fig. 6b).
Imaging With Balanced Steady State Free Precession
The simple multi-pulse scheme (Fig. 7a) used to derive the signal properties of SSFP has to be the translated into an imaging sequence. The phase advance f within TR was associated with off-resonance effects and reﬂects, thus, a global phase for all the spins within some given voxel. As a result, gradient moments have to be fully balanced between consecutive excitation pulses. A fully balanced SSFP imaging technique (see Fig. 7b) was already proposed in 1986 by Oppelt et al (24), but has become feasible only with the introduction of very fast, strong, and precise gradient systems. In contrast to the scheme proposed by Carr for spectroscopy (see Figs. 1 and 7a), RF phase alternation (6a, i.e., a coherent phase advance of 180 within TR) is commonly applied with balanced SSFP imaging techniques (see Fig. 7b) to generate a global 180 phase shift f ! f þ180 . As a result, the center of the pass-band is shifted from f ¼ 180 (for nonalternating RF phases) to f ¼ 0 (for alternating RF phases), i.e., to on-resonance. With state-of-the-art hardware components, it is now easily

from Eq, (4). This relatively complicated formula can be signiﬁcantly simpliﬁed taking into account that T1 and T2 relaxation times in biological tissue at ﬁeld strength between 0.5T and 4T are much larger than the typical repetition time of balanced SSFP. Thus, for TR < T2 T1, and incorporating alternating excitation pulses gives the simpliﬁed balanced SSFP signal (see Eq. (4)) (20,30).

In the illustrated scheme, the echo of balanced SSFP, sampled by the ADC, is centered between the RF pulses, i.e., at 2ÁTE ¼ TR (see also Fig. 6a).
possible to achieve very short repetition times (TR $ 3–6 ms, see Schefﬂer and Lehnhardt) (25), which is a precondition for successful, i.e., artifact free, balanced SSFP imaging. Because all gradient moments have to be fully balanced within each TR, bSSFP is very sensitive to any source of imperfection that disturbs the perfectly balanced acquisition scheme (see Fig. 7b), such as variable phase accruals from residual eddy currents (26), but in general shows quite some robustness against ﬂow or motion (27).
The steady state amplitude, as given by Eq. (4), relates to the magnetization immediately after the RF pulse. The echo amplitude at TE ¼ TR/2, however, is not additionally weighted by a factor of exp(ÀTE/T2*), as for the conventional RF-spoiled SSFP sequence, but gets nearly completely refocused, leading to the formation of a spin echo rather than a gradient echo (28), and interestingly the signal shows only marginal variations with TR, as long as, TR ( T2 T1 (29).
CONTRAST AND SNR OF BSSFP
Balanced SSFP imaging is implemented with alternating excitation pulses to conﬁne imaging at the highsignal pass band as shown in Figure 5. Figure 5 also shows that the pass band is relatively ﬂat if used in combination with high ﬂip angles around 30 to 90 . Therefore, application of alternating excitation pulses ensures a relatively homogenous signal intensity for possible deviation of the local resonance frequency due to susceptibility, shim or chemical shift effects. According to Figure 5 local phase advances are within one repetition time of approximately 6120 is acceptable without signiﬁcant signal deviations, which translates into a range of acceptable local frequency deviations of approximately 700 Hz/TR(ms). As a result, the repetition time of balanced SSFP always should be as short as possible, and is usually around 3 ms to 6 ms in conventional clinical applications to minimize banding artifacts.
The resulting steady state contrast of balanced SSFP for such short repetition times can be derived

This equation demonstrates that, for short repetition

times, the contrast of balanced SSFP is essentially

T2/T1-weighted, a new and interesting dependence on T1 and T2 that generates images far away from the established and known solely T1- or T2-weighted contrast. In addition to T1 and T2, this formula still has a dependence on the ﬂip angle. It can be shown

that, for given T1 and T2, the highest signal can be achieved at the ﬂip angle aopt given by (30).

again revealing the T2/T1-weighted contrast. This is an important and remarkable formula if
seen in the context of relaxation times of biological tissue. For example, water or liquids (and also tissues like fat) have a T1 relaxation time similar to T2 (i.e., T1 $ T2), resulting in an optimal ﬂip angle of 90 and signal of 0.5M0. This is exceptional! A gradient echo sequence with short repetition time and 90 ﬂip angle produces a steady state signal of 50% of the total available equilibrium magnetization M0; and this forever, without getting progressively saturated, as long as the sequence is not turned off. To date, no other type of sequence (ﬂip-back sequences are closely related to balanced SSFP) is known that produces a higher steady state signal. For more common combinations of T2/T1 ( 1, the optimal signal is around 10–30% of M0 and still signiﬁcantly higher than for FLASH sequences (to be qmﬃoﬃﬃrﬃﬃeﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃﬃpﬃﬃﬃrﬃ ecise, it is always higher by a factor of 1= 1 À E22 than FLASH), as shown in Figure 8. The signal-to-noise efﬁciency, which is proportional to the square root of the repetition time divided by the time period of signal reception, is similar to other sequences with spin warpbased Cartesian k-space sampling, as the time needed to travel in k-space without signal reception is comparable.
In addition to its unconventional T2/T1-weighted contrast, it is important to analyze contrast as a function of ﬂip angle and repetition time. For FLASH, these parameters critically determine the T1-weighting

and often produce changes in contrast if, for example, TR is increased to achieve a higher resolution. As shown in Figure 9 balanced SSFP reveals a signal that is virtually independent of TR, as long as TR is kept short compared with T1 and T2, even for a 300% increase in TR. As a result, balanced SSFP contrast is robust against changes in TR, and for example against changes in image resolution which is always related to changes in TR (for optimized sequences).

POSSIBILITIES TO MODIFY THE BSSFP CONTRAST Modifying the Flip Angles
Preparation of the initial equilibrium magnetization is a common approach to modify image contrast or to stabilize the transient phase of sequences. As shown above, balanced SSFP not only has a different

the TIDE technique for improved T2-weighting and/or intrinsic fat suppression, as shown in Figure 10e (11,31,32). Figure 10f shows a dual steady state that also can be used for fat suppression (33).
In general, the SSFP signal or contrast as stated in Eqs. (4–8), is valid only for ideal systems and conditions. Only recently, it was realized that, for common SSFP protocols, the signal from tissues can be strongly affected by magnetization transfer (MT) effects (29), leading to prominent deviations (up to 50%, or even more) from the common signal model (see Eq. (6)). Furthermore, the condition of quasi-instantaneous RF excitation pulses with respect to their repetition time is for contemporary SSFP protocols frequently not granted. Typically, with fast imaging protocols, the duration of the excitation pulses elongates over a considerable fraction of the TR time. As a result, the approximation of quasi-instantaneous RF excitation breaks down, leading to an overall increase in the steady state signal (34), however, without affecting the prominent T2/T1 contrast (35).

Figure 11. a: The T2-preparation image (T2-TIDE) has been achieved by a TIDE preparation that initially uses high ﬂip angles up to 180 degrees (to produce a T2-contrast similar to the TSE technique) followed by decreasing ﬂip angles. b: A conventional 3D bSSFP image that shows the T2/T1weighted steady state contrast and hence no grey-white matter contrast. c: An example of a T2-weighted resolution enhanced T1-insensitive steady-state imaging (RE-TOSSI) produced by the application of nonuniformely spaced inversion pulses. d: Compared with the conventional 2D bSSFP image, no fatty structures are visible in RE-TOSSI. The signiﬁcant contrast difference of the transient and steady state phase of bSSFP is clearly demonstrated in (b) and (d). As (b) is a 3D acquisition the contrast is in the steady state and thus T2/T1-weighte, whereas in (d) the partially T2-weighted transient contrast is visible.

Preparation Techniques
As for most other sequences, balanced SSFP can be combined with a preceding magnetization preparation module, for example, to suppress fat with frequency selective saturation pulses or with inversion pulses to null the signal of speciﬁc tissue or to sample the recovery of magnetization for T1 quantiﬁcation (9). An interesting preparation variant that is composed of several inversion pulses is the recently developed TOSSI technique (36). Application of nonuniformly spaced inversion pulses aligns the magnetization parallel and anti-parallel to B0 and produces a pure T2 contrast.
In contrast to other sequences, balanced SSFP allows the possibility to apply preparation pulses

contrast within the transient phase but also requires preparation pulses to suppress signal oscillation for a smooth approach to the steady state. The well-known a/2 – TR/2 preparation invented by Deimling and Heid (9) is an effective and simple technique to bring the magnetization to the desired position on the relaxation cone, as shown in Figure 10b. However, it can be shown that this simple technique is sensitive to local off-resonance frequencies, and thus several other preparation techniques have been described (6,12,13). In many commercial implementations, a slow increase (linear or other) of the initial ﬂip angles is implemented that signiﬁcantly reduces signal oscillation within the transient phase, as shown in Figure 10c and 10d for 7 and 40 linear steps to the ﬁnal ﬂip angle. Other preparation schemes with the combined goal of signal stabilization (or catalyzation) and contrast modiﬁcation have been proposed, for example,

within the running train of pulses without disturbance of the fragile steady state. A ﬂip back TR/2 – a/ 2 module that is identical to the time-reversed a/2 – TR/2 preparation stores the current steady state magnetization in the longitudinal direction, and, after application of a magnetization preparation module, is reused and reintroduced by means of the a/2 – TR/2 preparation into the balanced SSFP pulse train (23). This allows an effective and ﬂexible way of combining magnetization preparation with balanced SSFP, and so far, a similar technique for FLASH has not been discovered.
CLINICAL APPLICATIONS
A common feature of rapid SSFP sequences (whether balanced or not) is their mixed T1 and T2 contrast given by 1=2M0(T2/T1)1=2 (20). Unfortunately, the T2/T1weighted contrast is not optimal for diagnostic purposes. As described above, novel techniques, such as T2-TIDE and TOSSI (see Fig. 11a and 11b, and Fig. 11c and 11d), have been developed which produce a contrast that is closely related to T2, but their robustness and advances compared with TSE-based T2 techniques still has to be proven. Thus, major clinical applications have focused on rapid morphological imaging, especially of the beating heart (see Fig. 12), i.e., to assess ejection fractions, to evaluate ventricular function, to detect infarcted myocardium, and to image renal and coronary arteries (37,38). For these applications, the T2/T1-weighted signal generates a high contrast between blood and myocardium or vessel wall. In addition, cardiac imaging beneﬁts from the intrinsic ﬂow compensation of balanced SSFP along the phase and slice directions (for the twodimensional [2D] version), which reduces artifacts and enhances the signal of inﬂowing blood. Likewise, the high temporal resolution and robustness against motion and ﬂow is also beneﬁcial for interventional procedures where the movement of catheters, guidewires, or needles is monitored under MR guidance (39).
SUMMARY
Among all SSFP sequences, balanced SSFP offers the highest signal-to-noise, but has limited clinical application for diagnostic imaging due to the mixed T2/T1 contrast behavior. As a result, several magnetization preparation techniques were proposed over the years to yield, for speciﬁc applications, a more diagnostically relevant contrast. In contrast to nonbalanced SSFP, bSSFP is quite robust against motion or ﬂow and has thus become a valuable tool for functional or morphological imaging, such as for cardio-vascular applications.
