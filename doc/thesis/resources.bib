	abstract = {Validation can be used to detect when overfitting starts during supervised training of a neural network; training is then stopped before convergence to avoid the overfitting (“early stopping”). The exact criterion used for validation-based early stopping, however, is usually chosen in an ad-hoc fashion or training is stopped interactively. This trick describes how to select a stopping criterion in a systematic fashion; it is a trick for either speeding learning procedures or improving generalization, whichever is more important in the particular situation. An empirical investigation on multi-layer perceptrons shows that there exists a tradeoff between training time and generalization: From the given mix of 1296 training runs using difierent 12 problems and 24 difierent network architectures I conclude slower stopping criteria allow for small improvements in generalization (here: about 4\% on average), but cost much more training time (here: about factor 4 longer on average).},

In this paper, we present a network and training strategy that relies on the strong use of data augmentation to use the available annotated samples more efficiently. The architecture consists of a contracting path to capture context and a symmetric expanding path that enables precise localization. We show that such a network can be trained end-to-end from very few images and outperforms the prior best method (a sliding-window convolutional network) on the ISBI challenge for segmentation of neuronal structures in electron microscopic stacks. Using the same network trained on transmitted light microscopy images (phase contrast and DIC) we won the ISBI cell tracking challenge 2015 in these categories by a large margin. Moreover, the network is fast. Segmentation of a 512x512 image takes less than a second on a recent GPU.

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2302.11529},
	abstract = {Transfer learning has recently become the dominant paradigm of machine learning. Pre-trained models fine-tuned for downstream tasks achieve better performance with fewer labelled examples. Nonetheless, it remains unclear how to develop models that specialise towards multiple tasks without incurring negative interference and that generalise systematically to non-identically distributed tasks. Modular deep learning has emerged as a promising solution to these challenges. In this framework, units of computation are often implemented as autonomous parameter-efficient modules. Information is conditionally routed to a subset of modules and subsequently aggregated. These properties enable positive transfer and systematic generalisation by separating computation from routing and updating modules locally. We offer a survey of modular architectures, providing a unified view over several threads of research that evolved independently in the scientific literature. Moreover, we explore various additional purposes of modularity, including scaling language models, causal inference, programme induction, and planning in reinforcement learning. Finally, we report various concrete applications where modularity has been successfully deployed such as cross-lingual and cross-modal knowledge transfer. Related talks and projects to this survey, are available at https://www.modulardeeplearning.com/.},

	abstract = {We present a cross-modality generation framework that learns to generate translated modalities from given modalities in MR images. Our proposed method performs Image Modality Translation (abbreviated as IMT) by means of a deep learning model that leverages conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs). Our framework jointly exploits the low-level features (pixel-wise information) and high-level representations (e.g. brain tumors, brain structure like gray matter, etc.) between cross modalities which are important for resolving the challenging complexity in brain structures. Our framework can serve as an auxiliary method in medical use and has great application potential. Based on our proposed framework, we first propose a method for cross-modality registration by fusing the deformation fields to adopt the cross-modality information from translated modalities. Second, we propose an approach for MRI segmentation, translated multichannel segmentation (TMS), where given modalities, along with translated modalities, are segmented by fully convolutional networks (FCN) in a multichannel manner. Both of these two methods successfully adopt the cross-modality information to improve the performance without adding any extra data. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed framework advances the state-of-the-art on five brain MRI datasets. We also observe encouraging results in cross-modality registration and segmentation on some widely adopted brain datasets. Overall, our work can serve as an auxiliary method in medical use and be applied to various tasks in medical fields.},

	volume = {208},
	issn = {0169-2607},
	shorttitle = {{TorchIO}},
	url = {https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169260721003102},
	doi = {10.1016/j.cmpb.2021.106236},
	abstract = {Background and objective
Processing of medical images such as MRI or CT presents different challenges compared to RGB images typically used in computer vision. These include a lack of labels for large datasets, high computational costs, and the need of metadata to describe the physical properties of voxels. Data augmentation is used to artificially increase the size of the training datasets. Training with image subvolumes or patches decreases the need for computational power. Spatial metadata needs to be carefully taken into account in order to ensure a correct alignment and orientation of volumes.
Methods
We present TorchIO, an open-source Python library to enable efficient loading, preprocessing, augmentation and patch-based sampling of medical images for deep learning. TorchIO follows the style of PyTorch and integrates standard medical image processing libraries to efficiently process images during training of neural networks. TorchIO transforms can be easily composed, reproduced, traced and extended. Most transforms can be inverted, making the library suitable for test-time augmentation and estimation of aleatoric uncertainty in the context of segmentation. We provide multiple generic preprocessing and augmentation operations as well as simulation of MRI-specific artifacts.
Results
Source code, comprehensive tutorials and extensive documentation for TorchIO can be found at http://torchio.rtfd.io/. The package can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) running pip install torchio. It includes a command-line interface which allows users to apply transforms to image files without using Python. Additionally, we provide a graphical user interface within a TorchIO extension in 3D Slicer to visualize the effects of transforms.
Conclusion
TorchIO was developed to help researchers standardize medical image processing pipelines and allow them to focus on the deep learning experiments. It encourages good open-science practices, as it supports experiment reproducibility and is version-controlled so that the software can be cited precisely. Due to its modularity, the library is compatible with other frameworks for deep learning with medical images.},

Because the computer gathers knowledge from experience, there is no need for a human computer operator to formally specify all the knowledge that the computer needs. The hierarchy of concepts allows the computer to learn complicated concepts by building them out of simpler ones; a graph of these hierarchies would be many layers deep. This book introduces a broad range of topics in deep learning. The text offers mathematical and conceptual background, covering relevant concepts in linear algebra, probability theory and information theory, numerical computation, and machine learning. It describes deep learning techniques used by practitioners in industry, including deep feedforward networks, regularization, optimization algorithms, convolutional networks, sequence modeling, and practical methodology; and it surveys such applications as natural language processing, speech recognition, computer vision, online recommendation systems, bioinformatics, and videogames. Finally, the book offers research perspectives, covering such theoretical topics as linear factor models, autoencoders, representation learning, structured probabilistic models, Monte Carlo methods, the partition function, approximate inference, and deep generative models. Deep Learning can be used by undergraduate or graduate students planning careers in either industry or research, and by software engineers who want to begin using deep learning in their products or platforms.

	abstract = {Deep learning frameworks have often focused on either usability or speed, but not both. PyTorch is a machine learning library that shows that these two goals are in fact compatible: it was designed from first principles to support an imperative and Pythonic programming style that supports code as a model, makes debugging easy and is consistent with other popular scientific computing libraries, while remaining efficient and supporting hardware accelerators such as GPUs.
In this paper, we detail the principles that drove the implementation of PyTorch and how they are reflected in its architecture. We emphasize that every aspect of PyTorch is a regular Python program under the full control of its user. We also explain how the careful and pragmatic implementation of the key components of its runtime enables them to work together to achieve compelling performance.
We demonstrate the efficiency of individual subsystems, as well as the overall speed of PyTorch on several commonly used benchmarks.},

In this paper, we regard each image-to-image translation problem as a downstream task and introduce a simple and generic framework that adapts a pretrained diffusion model to accommodate various kinds of image-to-image translation. We also propose adversarial training to enhance the texture synthesis in the diffusion model training, in conjunction with normalized guidance sampling to improve the generation quality. We present extensive empirical comparison across various tasks on challenging benchmarks such as ADE20K, COCO-Stuff, and DIODE, showing the proposed pretraining-based image-to-image translation (PITI) is capable of synthesizing images of unprecedented realism and faithfulness.},

	abstract = {The literature has proposed several methods to finetune pretrained GANs on new datasets, which typically results in higher performance compared to training from scratch, especially in the limited-data regime. However, despite the apparent empirical benefits of GAN pretraining, its inner mechanisms were not analyzed in-depth, and understanding of its role is not entirely clear. Moreover, the essential practical details, e.g., selecting a proper pretrained GAN checkpoint, currently do not have rigorous grounding and are typically determined by trial and error. This work aims to dissect the process of GAN finetuning. First, we show that initializing the GAN training process by a pretrained checkpoint primarily affects the model's coverage rather than the fidelity of individual samples. Second, we explicitly describe how pretrained generators and discriminators contribute to the finetuning process and explain the previous evidence on the importance of pretraining both of them. Finally, as an immediate practical benefit of our analysis, we describe a simple recipe to choose an appropriate GAN checkpoint that is the most suitable for finetuning to a particular target task. Importantly, for most of the target tasks, Imagenet-pretrained GAN, despite having poor visual quality, appears to be an excellent starting point for finetuning, resembling the typical pretraining scenario of discriminative computer vision models.},

	abstract = {Statistical parametric maps are spatially extended statistical processes that are used to test hypotheses about regionally specific effects in neuroimaging data. The most established sorts of statistical parametric maps (e.g., Friston et al. [1991]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 11:690–699; Worsley et al. [1992]: J Cereb Blood Flow Metab 12:900–918) are based on linear models, for example ANCOVA, correlation coefficients and t tests. In the sense that these examples are all special cases of the general linear model it should be possible to implement them (and many others) within a unified framework. We present here a general approach that accomodates most forms of experimental layout and ensuing analysis (designed experiments with fixed effects for factors, covariates and interaction of factors). This approach brings together two well established bodies of theory (the general linear model and the theory of Gaussian fields) to provide a complete and simple framework for the analysis of imaging data. The importance of this framework is twofold: (i) Conceptual and mathematical simplicity, in that the same small number of operational equations is used irrespective of the complexity of the experiment or nature of the statistical model and (ii) the generality of the framework provides for great latitude in experimental design and analysis. © 1995 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging in biochemical and clinical research requires rapid imaging sequences. Time-resolved imaging of heart movement and the acquisition of a three-dimensional image block within the circulation time of a contrast agent bolus are two typical examples. Rapid imaging sequences are characterized by a very fast train of radiofrequency (rf) and gradient pulses. Between these rf pulses, the excited magnetization is unable to return to its thermal equilibrium. As a consequence, further rf pulses will influence both the remaining transversal and the remaining equilibrium state. The steady-state magnetization of a multi-rf pulse and gradient pulse experiment is thus a mixture or superposition of different transversal and longitudinal states and the acquired image amplitude becomes a complex function of the investigated tissue's relaxation properties. Based on the works of Woessner, Kaiser, and Hennig, this article intends to give a pictorial description of rapid multipulse imaging experiments.

	abstract = {Purpose Rapid imaging techniques have attracted increased interest for relaxometry, but none are perfect: they are prone to static (B0) and transmit (B1) field heterogeneities, and commonly biased by T2/T1. The purpose of this study is the development of a rapid T1 and T2 relaxometry method that is completely (T2) or partly (T1) bias-free. Methods A new method is introduced to simultaneously quantify T1 and T2 within one single scan based on a triple echo steady-state (TESS) approach in combination with an iterative golden section search. TESS relaxometry is optimized and evaluated from simulations, in vitro studies, and in vivo experiments. Results It is found that relaxometry with TESS is not biased by T2/T1, insensitive to B0 heterogeneities, and, surprisingly, that TESS-T2 is not affected by B1 field errors. Consequently, excellent correspondence between TESS and reference spin echo data is observed for T2 in vitro at 1.5 T and in vivo at 3 T. Conclusion TESS offers rapid T1 and T2 quantification within one single scan, and in particular B1-insensitive T2 estimation. As a result, the new proposed method is of high interest for fast and reliable high-resolution T2 mapping, especially of the musculoskeletal system at high to ultra-high fields.

	abstract = {Spoiled gradient echo sequences can only reach a homogeneous steady state if sufficiently strong crusher gradients are used in combination with RF phase cycling (RF spoiling). However, the signal depends quite sensitively on the chosen phase increment ϕ and—lacking analytical solutions—numerical simulations must be used to study the transient and steady-state magnetization. For the steady state an exact analytical solution is derived, which holds for arbitrary sequence and tissue parameters. Besides a considerably improved computation performance, the analytical approach enables a better understanding of the complicated dependence on ϕ. For short repetition times (TR) the regime of small ϕ turns out to be particularly interesting: It is shown that the typical ϕc, where RF spoiling starts to become effective, is essentially inversely proportional to T2. This tissue dependence implies that contrasts can be considerably larger with partial spoiling (ϕ ≈ ϕc) than with conventional RF spoiling (ϕ ≫ ϕc). As an example, the uptake of contrast agents in tissues is investigated. For typical parameters a considerably improved contrast enhancement can be obtained, both theoretically and experimentally.

Due to its unbalanced gradient scheme, however, TESS is inherently motion-sensitive. The purpose of this work is to merge TESS with a balanced acquisition scheme for motion-insensitive rapid configuration relaxometry, termed MIRACLE. Methods The lowest order steady state free precession (SSFP) configurations are retrieved by Fourier transformation of the frequency response of N frequency-shifted balanced SSFP (bSSFP) scans and subsequently processed for relaxometry, as proposed with TESS. Accuracy of MIRACLE is evaluated from simulations, phantom studies as well as in vivo brain and cartilage imaging at 3T. Results Simulations and phantom results revealed no conceptual flaw, and artifact-free configuration imaging was achieved in vivo. Overall, relaxometry results were accurate in phantoms and in good agreement for cartilage and for in the brain, but apparent low values were observed for brain white matter; reflecting asymmetries in the bSSFP profile. Conclusion Rapid and mapping with MIRACLE offers analogous properties as TESS while successfully mitigating its motion-sensitivity. As a result of the Fourier transformation, relaxometry becomes sensitive to the voxel frequency distribution, which may contain useful physiologic information, such as structural brain integrity. © 2016 International Society for Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

	abstract = {The term “diffusion tensor imaging” (DTI) is used on many occasions to informally refer to anything related to diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). From a formal point of view, however, DTI is the practice of fitting a tensor model to the DWI data. It is one of the simplest ways to model the DWI data that accounts, up to some extent, for the anisotropy in this kind of data. Exploiting this anisotropy is key to obtaining the characteristic directionally encoded color (DEC) maps and tractograms that are typically associated to the practice of DWI in general. Hence, it is not surprising many people use the term “DTI” in very different contexts. In this chapter, we aim to give the reader a feeling for what is really under the hood of the true art of DTI: obtaining these so-called diffusion tensors. What are they actually modeling? And, in this context, what is a tensor anyway? There’s a short and clear answer to this: the diffusion tensor describes the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), in function of direction. Hmm… “ADC” you say…?},

This introduction is not intended to be a comprehensive overview of the field, as the subject of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) physics is large and complex. Rather, it is intended to lay a conceptual foundation by which magnetic resonance image formation can be understood from an intuitive perspective. The presentation is nonmathematical, relying on simple models that take the reader progressively from the basic spin physics of nuclei, through descriptions of how the magnetic resonance signal is generated and detected in an MRI scanner, the foundations of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) relaxation, and a discussion of the Fourier transform and its relation to MR image formation. The article continues with a discussion of how magnetic field gradients are used to facilitate spatial encoding and concludes with a development of basic pulse sequences and the factors defining image contrast.

	abstract = {The extended phase graph (EPG) concept represents a powerful tool for depicting and understanding the magnetization response of a broad variety of MR sequences. EPGs focus on echo generation as well as on classification and use a Fourier based magnetization description in terms of “configurations states”. The effect of gradients, radiofrequency (RF) pulses, relaxation, and motion phenomena during the MR sequence is characterized as the action of a few matrix operations on these configuration states. Thus, the EPG method allows for fast and precise quantitation of echo intensities even if several gradients and RF pulses are applied. EPG diagrams aid in the comprehension of different types of echoes and their corresponding echo time. Despite its several benefits in regard to a large number of problems and issues, researchers and users still often refrain from applying EPGs. It seems that “phase graphing” is still seen as a kind of “magic.” The present review investigates the foundation of EPGs and sheds light on prerequisites for adding more advanced phenomena such as diffusion. The links between diagrams and calculations are discussed. A further focus is on limitations and simplifications as well recent extensions within the EPG concept. To make the review complete, representative software for EPG coding is provided. J. Magn. Reson. Imaging 2015;41:266–295.© 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Transforming the data to a frequency or other domain enables even more efficient compression. By illustrating this intimate link, The Transform and Data Compression Handbook serves as a much-needed handbook for a wide range of researchers and engineers.The authors describe various discrete transforms and their applications in different disciplines. They cover techniques, such as adaptive quantization and entropy coding, that result in significant reduction in bit rates when applied to the transform coefficients. With clear and concise presentations of the ideas and concepts, as well as detailed descriptions of the algorithms, the authors provide important insight into the applications and their limitations. Data compression is an essential step towards the efficient storage and transmission of information. The Transform and Data Compression Handbook provides a wealth of information regarding different discrete transforms and demonstrates their power and practicality in data compression.},

Despite this, the most widely used perceptual metrics today, such as PSNR and SSIM, are simple, shallow functions, and fail to account for many nuances of human perception. Recently, the deep learning community has found that features of the VGG network trained on ImageNet classification has been remarkably useful as a training loss for image synthesis. But how perceptual are these so-called "perceptual losses"? What elements are critical for their success? To answer these questions, we introduce a new dataset of human perceptual similarity judgments. We systematically evaluate deep features across different architectures and tasks and compare them with classic metrics. We find that deep features outperform all previous metrics by large margins on our dataset. More surprisingly, this result is not restricted to ImageNet-trained VGG features, but holds across different deep architectures and levels of supervision (supervised, self-supervised, or even unsupervised). Our results suggest that perceptual similarity is an emergent property shared across deep visual representations.},

Models pre-trained from massive dataset such as ImageNet become a powerful weapon for speeding up training convergence and improving accuracy. Similarly, models based on large dataset are important for the development of deep learning in 3D medical images. However, it is extremely challenging to build a sufficiently large dataset due to difficulty of data acquisition and annotation in 3D medical imaging. We aggregate the dataset from several medical challenges to build 3DSeg-8 dataset with diverse modalities, target organs, and pathologies. To extract general medical three-dimension (3D) features, we design a heterogeneous 3D network called Med3D to co-train multi-domain 3DSeg-8 so as to make a series of pre-trained models. We transfer Med3D pre-trained models to lung segmentation in LIDC dataset, pulmonary nodule classification in LIDC dataset and liver segmentation on LiTS challenge. Experiments show that the Med3D can accelerate the training convergence speed of target 3D medical tasks 2 times compared with model pre-trained on Kinetics dataset, and 10 times compared with training from scratch as well as improve accuracy ranging from 3\% to 20\%. Transferring our Med3D model on state-the-of-art DenseASPP segmentation network, in case of single model, we achieve 94.6{\textbackslash}\% Dice coefficient which approaches the result of top-ranged algorithms on the LiTS challenge.},

The second class of coils employed in MRI are linear magnetic field gradient coils. These coils are used to encode spatially the positions of the spins in MRI by varying the value of the local magnetic field causing spins Larmor frequencies to vary as a function of their positions. These coils are rapidly switched during MRI sequences to allow the collection of large regions of κ-space in a short amount of time.

Low-resolution target diffusion data are derived based on diffusion-weighted spin-echo echo-planar-imaging (SE-EPI) scans, that is, mean, axial, and radial diffusivity (MD, AD, and RD), fractional anisotropy (FA), as well as the spherical coordinates (azimuth Φ and inclination ϴ) of the principal diffusion eigenvector. A feedforward NN is trained with incorporated probabilistic uncertainty estimation. The NN predictions yielded highly reliable results in white matter (WM) and gray matter structures for MD. The quantification of FA, AD, and RD was overall in good agreement with the reference but the dependence of these parameters on WM anisotropy was somewhat biased (e.g. in corpus callosum). The inclination ϴ was well predicted for anisotropic WM structures, while the azimuth Φ was overall poorly predicted. The findings were highly consistent across both field strengths. Application of the optimized NN to high-resolution input data provided whole-brain maps with rich structural details. In conclusion, the proposed NN-driven approach showed potential to provide distortion-free high-resolution whole-brain maps of multiple diffusion metrics at high to ultrahigh field strengths in clinically relevant scan times.},

The basic imaging parameters repetition time (TR) and echo time (TE) and their influence on the image contrast are explained.

Compared with spin-echo techniques, the very short repetition times of gradient-echo methods enable very rapid 2D and 3D imaging, but also lead to complicated “steady states.” Signal and contrast behavior can be described graphically and mathematically, and depends strongly on the type of spoiling: fully balanced (no spoiling), gradient spoiling, or RF-spoiling. These spoiling options trade off between high signal and pure T1 contrast while the flip angle also affects image contrast in all cases, both of which can be demonstrated theoretically and in image examples. As with spin-echo sequences, magnetization preparation can be added to gradient-echo sequences to alter image contrast. Gradient echo sequences are widely used for numerous applications such as 3D perfusion imaging, functional MRI, cardiac imaging and MR angiography.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Few studies have concerned the absolute apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the normal human brain and the effect of aging on diffusion. Therefore, our purpose was to determine whether the average ADC (ADCav) values in the various regions of the brain differ with age, sex, or hemisphere and to establish reference values of the absolute ADCav for further studies.
METHODS: Subjects (40 men and 40 women) were chosen from a healthy population; age groups were 20–34, 35–49, and 50–64 years and 65 years or older (n = 20 each). All subjects were examined with MR imaging, including conventional and diffusion-weighted imaging in three orthogonal directions with two b values (0 and 1000 s/mm2) at 1.5 T. Bilateral ADCav values were determined in 36 regions of interest encompassing the entire brain.
RESULTS: ADCav values were highest in the cortical gray matter ([0.89 ± 0.04] × 10−3 mm2/s; range, 0.78–1.09 × 10−3), lower in the deep gray matter ([0.75 ± 0.03] × 10−3 mm2/s; range, 0.64–0.83 × 10−3), and lowest in the white matter ([0.70 ± 0.03] × 10−3 mm2/s; range, 0.62–0.79 × 10−3). The ADCav values did not significantly change with aging, except for an increase in the lateral ventricles. No difference was observed between women and men or between the hemispheres.
CONCLUSION: The data reported herein are representative, and the ADCav values can be used for reference in future studies and in clinical settings.},

In the normal white matter ADC ranges were 0.60–1.05×10−3mm2/s, and the mean ADC value was 0.84±0.11×10−3mm2/s.

Further studies can provide addition of different lesions as well as refinements of these categories.},

Relaxation is a fundamental aspect of MR, as essential as energy absorption, and provides the primary mechanism for image contrast. In resonance absorption, RF energy is absorbed by the protons only when it is broadcast at the correct frequency. Following excitation, relaxation occurs in which the protons release this added energy and return to their original configuration through naturally occurring processes. Two relaxation times can be measured, known as T1 and T2. While both times measure the spontaneous energy transfer by an excited proton, they differ in the final disposition of the energy. The rate of RF pulse application and the efficiency of energy transfer must have the proper balance. Spin-lattice relaxation measures the rate of energy transfer from an excited proton to its surroundings.},

	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v9/glorot10a.html},
	abstract = {Whereas before 2006 it appears that deep multi-layer neural networks were not successfully trained, since then several algorithms have been shown to successfully train them, with experimental results showing the superiority of deeper vs less deep architectures. All these experimental results were obtained with new initialization or training mechanisms. Our objective here is to understand better why standard gradient descent from random initialization is doing so poorly with deep neural networks, to better understand these recent relative successes and help design better algorithms in the future.  We first observe the influence of the non-linear activations functions. We find that the logistic sigmoid activation is unsuited for deep networks with random initialization because of its mean value, which can drive especially the top hidden layer into saturation. Surprisingly, we find that saturated units can move out of saturation by themselves, albeit slowly, and explaining the plateaus sometimes seen when training neural networks. We find that a new non-linearity that saturates less can often be beneficial. Finally, we study how activations and gradients vary across layers and during training, with the idea that training may be more difficult when the singular values of the Jacobian associated with each layer are far from 1.  Based on these considerations, we propose a new initialization scheme that brings substantially faster convergence.},

The ReLU network can be analyzed by the ridgelet transform with respect to Lizorkin distributions. By showing three reconstruction formulas by using the Fourier slice theorem, the Radon transform, and Parseval's relation, it is shown that a neural network with unbounded activation functions still satisfies the universal approximation property. As an additional consequence, the ridgelet transform, or the backprojection filter in the Radon domain, is what the network learns after backpropagation. Subject to a constructive admissibility condition, the trained network can be obtained by simply discretizing the ridgelet transform, without backpropagation. Numerical examples not only support the consistency of the admissibility condition but also imply that some non-admissible cases result in low-pass filtering.},

	abstract = {Training Deep Neural Networks is complicated by the fact that the distribution of each layer's inputs changes during training, as the parameters of the previous layers change. This slows down the training by requiring lower learning rates and careful parameter initialization, and makes it notoriously hard to train models with saturating nonlinearities. We refer to this phenomenon as internal covariate shift, and address the problem by normalizing layer inputs. Our method draws its strength from making normalization a part of the model architecture and performing the normalization for each training mini-batch. Batch Normalization allows us to use much higher learning rates and be less careful about initialization, and in some cases eliminates the need for Dropout. Applied to a state-of-the-art image classification model, Batch Normalization achieves the same accuracy with 14 times fewer training steps, and beats the original model by a significant margin. Using an ensemble of batch-normalized networks, we improve upon the best published result on ImageNet classification: reaching 4.82\% top-5 test error, exceeding the accuracy of human raters.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.1607.06450},
	abstract = {Training state-of-the-art, deep neural networks is computationally expensive. One way to reduce the training time is to normalize the activities of the neurons. A recently introduced technique called batch normalization uses the distribution of the summed input to a neuron over a mini-batch of training cases to compute a mean and variance which are then used to normalize the summed input to that neuron on each training case. This significantly reduces the training time in feed-forward neural networks. However, the effect of batch normalization is dependent on the mini-batch size and it is not obvious how to apply it to recurrent neural networks. In this paper, we transpose batch normalization into layer normalization by computing the mean and variance used for normalization from all of the summed inputs to the neurons in a layer on a single training case. Like batch normalization, we also give each neuron its own adaptive bias and gain which are applied after the normalization but before the non-linearity. Unlike batch normalization, layer normalization performs exactly the same computation at training and test times. It is also straightforward to apply to recurrent neural networks by computing the normalization statistics separately at each time step. Layer normalization is very effective at stabilizing the hidden state dynamics in recurrent networks. Empirically, we show that layer normalization can substantially reduce the training time compared with previously published techniques.},

Large networks are also slow to use, making it difficult to deal with overfitting by combining the predictions of many different large neural nets at test time. Dropout is a technique for addressing this problem. The key idea is to randomly drop units (along with their connections) from the neural network during training. This prevents units from co-adapting too much. During training, dropout samples from an exponential number of different thinned networks. At test time, it is easy to approximate the effect of averaging the predictions of all these thinned networks by simply using a single unthinned network that has smaller weights. This significantly reduces overfitting and gives major improvements over other regularization methods. We show that dropout improves the performance of neural networks on supervised learning tasks in vision, speech recognition, document classification and computational biology, obtaining state-of-the-art results on many benchmark data sets.},

	abstract = {A method for computing optical flow using a neural network is presented. Usually, the measurement primitives used for computing optical flow from successive image frames are the image-intensity values and their spatial and temporal derivatives, and tokens such as edges, corners, and linear features. Conventional methods based on such primitives suffer from edge sparsity, noise distortion, or sensitivity to rotation. The authors first fit a 2-D polynomial to find a smooth continuous image-intensity function in a window and estimate the subpixel intensity values and their principal curvatures. Under the local rigidity assumption and smoothness constraints, a neural network is then used to implement the computing procedure based on the estimated intensity values and their principal curvatures. Owing to the dense measured primitives, a dense optical flow with subpixel accuracy is obtained with only a few iterations. Since intensity values and their principle curvatures are rotation-invariant, this method can detect both rotating and translating objects in the scene. Experimental results using synthetic image sequences demonstrate the efficacy of the method.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

Convolutional Neural Network is a special type of DNN consisting of several convolution layers, each followed by an activation function and a pooling layer. The pooling layer is an important layer that executes the down-sampling on the feature maps coming from the previous layer and produces new feature maps with a condensed resolution. This layer drastically reduces the spatial dimension of input. It serves two main purposes. The first is to reduce the number of parameters or weights, thus lessening the computational cost. The second is to control the overfitting of the network. An ideal pooling method is expected to extract only useful information and discard irrelevant details. There are a lot of methods for the implementation of pooling operation in Deep Neural Networks. In this paper, we reviewed some of the famous and useful pooling methods.},
