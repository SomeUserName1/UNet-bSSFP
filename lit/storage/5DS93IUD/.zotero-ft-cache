1. Getting Started: A Simple Example

Matplotlib has a Matlab emulation environment called PyLab, which is a simple wrapper of the matplotlib API. Although many die-hard Pythonistas bristle at PyLab's Matlab-like syntax and its from pylab import * examples, which dump the PyLab and NumPy functionality into a single namespace for ease of use, this feature is an essential selling point for many teachers whose students aren't programmers and don't want to be: they just want to get up and running. For many of these students, Matlab is the only exposure to programming they've ever had, and the ability to leverage that knowledge is often a critical point for teachers trying to bring Python into the science classroom. In Figure 2, I've enabled the usetex parameter in the matplotlib configuration file so LaTeX can generate both the text and the equations.
