         \textbf{A. \& B.} SNc and projections to the dorsal striatum in healthy subjects and patients with PD.
         In the healthy subject, the SNc is still highly pigmented due to the melanin-containing dopamine-producing cells being intact.
         The SNc projects to the striatum and delivers normal amounts of DA into the basal ganglia (BG) circuit.
         If the dopamine-producing neurons undergo apoptosis, the pigmentation decreases and so does the amount of dopamine adimnistered to the striatum.
         \textbf{C.} Photomicrographs of Lewy bodies.
