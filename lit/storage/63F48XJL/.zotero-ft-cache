    Summary:

    This chapter introduces the basic electromagnetic and mathematical concepts needed to understand the design of the coils that generate the fields used in MRI. It discusses the desirable properties of the various coil systems (main magnet, rf, and gradient). The design of coils lies primarily in determining the optimal arrangements of current necessary to produce the magnetic fields used in MRI. The second class of coils employed in MRI are linear magnetic field gradient coils. These coils are used to encode spatially the positions of the spins in MRI by varying the value of the local magnetic field causing spins Larmor frequencies to vary as a function of their positions. These coils are rapidly switched during MRI sequences to allow the collection of large regions of κ‐space in a short amount of time. It gives a brief introduction to radiofrequency power deposition and specific absorption rate.

27.2. The Main Magnet Coil 833 27.2.2 Desirable Properties of Main Magnets In order to develop optimal coils, the important operational parameters of the object should be well understood. Several important aspects of the MRI main magnet include: field strength, homogeneity, temporal stability, patient access and comfort, cost effectiveness, minimization of fields generated outside the imaging environment, and access to the patient during scanning for invasive procedures. Maximizing Field Strength As mentioned in the introduction the maximum available SNR for an MR experiment is proportional to B α 0 ;( α ≥ 1) with some variability in the value of the exponent as a function of B 0 . Since MRI is an inherently low SNR phenomenon, a primary goal of MRI main magnet design to increase SNR is to maximize B 0 (see Sec. 15.8.2). Maximization of B 0 explains two common aspects of contemporary high field MRI systems. The first is the solenoidal or cylindrical magnet structure. The cylindrical structure of the magnet allows a large amount of field producing wire to be placed close to the imaging environment and is also attractive from an engineering point of view. The second aspect of contemporary machines dictated by increasing B 0 is the use of superconductors to generate B 0 . The magnetic field a wire generates is linearly proportional to the current it carries. A copper wire, operating at room temperature, a few millimeters in diameter, can carry approximately 10 amps continuously, and a bundle of such wires must be cooled since the resistance causes a lot of power to be deposited in the wires as heat. A superconducting wire of 1 mm in diameter, however, can support more than a hundred amps of current with no associated heating. The presence of resistance in a room temperature copper wire also means that power must constantly be fed to maintain the field, but a superconducting system will run indefinitely with no additional power, excluding refrigeration, if it is kept superconducting. Temporal and Spatial Uniformity As a matter of convention, homogeneity of an MRI magnet is quoted in terms of inhomo- geneity or Δ B 0 . For example, if a magnet is said to have a homogeneity of 20 ppm, this means that the field varies by 20 millionths of its average value over the region-of-interest. It must be kept in mind that ppm is a relative measure (1 ppm of x =1 / 1 , 000 , 000 of x ), but the effect on imaging is a function of the actual field difference. For example, a 1.0 T magnet with a homogeneity of 10 ppm and a 10 T magnet with 10 ppm of homogeneity would have image distortion and signal loss problems due to static field inhomogeneities that differ in magnitude by approximately a factor of ten. An accepted homogeneity level for contempo- rary whole-body clinical imaging machines might be given as 5 ppm over a 50 cm diameter spherical volume at 1.5 T. All of these figures show that the static field used in MRI must be very homogeneous . In order to achieve this level of homogeneity the classic designs described previously are not adequate. In reality, sets of coils such as those shown in Fig. 27.8 are used to obtain ppm homogeneity levels and high field strengths. These coils are developed with an identical philosophy to that described for t he Helmholtz coil, except more coils have been added to cancel progressively higher order contaminating moments. The level of accuracy
834 Chapter 27. Introduction to MRI Coils and Magnets required leads to a unique set of requirements in accuracy of field modeling, and manufacture of coil sets. The required homogeneity of an MRI magnet is dictated by the desire to avoid the field distortion effects outlined in previous chapters. In order to avoid a majority of field distortion errors, the homogeneity of the magnet should be such that T ′ 2 due to static field inhomogeneities is much longer than an average data acquisition or read gradient period. The spatial frequency of variation in B 0 must also be very low so that Δ B 0 across a pixel is much less than G x Δ x . In other words, spins are not affected as much by field inhomogeneity as by applied gradient effects. To determine what homogeneity for a magnet is required, however, is difficult because some imaging methodologies require more uniformity than others. The question is also dependent upon the volume being considered, and a magnet with 15 ppm of homogeneity on a 50 cm diameter spherical volume (DSV) may also be able to claim less than 2 ppm on a 30 cm DSV. This is easy to understand from a moment analysis of the magnetic field (see Fig. 27.3) which demonstrates that error contributions are smaller near the origin. This explains why some imaging methods which may be employed on a small volume sample (human head, for example) are much more difficult to use for scanning a larger volume. The label static implies that the field is independent of time, and in MRI a field which is independent of time would be defined by one which varied by less than a few ppm over the total imaging time, T T . It is found that for superconducting magnets the fields often vary less than a μ T/hour. Therefore, for all practical purposes the time dependence of the main field can be neglected for a superconducting system. This is not the case for a system using resistive wire. In this case variations of the field may occur over times much less than T T , resulting in image errors due to incorrect demodulation of the signal. Fig. 27.9: Example of a 1.0 T magnet system with and without active shielding. The two lines circling the magnet represent the 5 G lines before and after shielding is introduced to the system.
27.2. The Main Magnet Coil 835 Fringe Field Effects Another concern which must be considered wh en designing an MRI main magnet is the effect of the field on nearby electronic devices. Fields in excess of 5 G (5 × 10 − 4 T) are considered to pose potential risks to people using electronic health aids. Therefore, fields produced outside of the imaging region (fringe fields) must also be considered in the initial design. In fact, unshielded magnets at 0.5 T and above can produce fields in excess of 5 G at distances of 10 to 30 m from the imaging site (see Fig. 27.9), and in hospitals where space is at a premium, shielding of these fields must be one of the primary design concerns. Problem 27.5 There are really two concerns in the immediate area of MRI main magnets: one is the increased static field level, and the other is the large static field gradients near the magnet. Consider the following situations where a small circular loop will be used to approximate the wires in an electronic device which may be employed near an MRI system. a) Consider a circular loop of wire that is initially aligned so that its area vector is parallel to the field, and rotates to a position anti-parallel to the field in 1 s (example of time it may take a person to turn quickly). Take the radius of the wire to be 10 cm. Approximate the emf induced in the coil in a 5 G field, the earth’s magnetic field ( B earth ≈ 1 G), and a 1.5 T field. b) Consider moving the same loop from part (a) near the magnet where the magnitude of the field is varying rapidly. Consider a person walking through a region where the field varies linearly from 0 T to 1.0 T in 1.0 m. Assume the area vector of the loop is aligned parallel to the field and that the person is walking at a rate of 3 mile/hr. Calculate the emf induced in the loop. c) Based on your answers to the previous parts, would you expect the induced voltages given to be large enough to affect the function of a solid-state device such as a calculator? Problem 27.6 Answer the following questions about how an iron paper clip would behave in and around an MRI machine. a) If the paper clip is released from rest in a perfectly uniform field, what will happen? b) The paper clip is placed on a frictionless imaging table just outside the bore of an MRI machine. Describe what will happen to the paper clip, and estimate the velocity of the paper clip in the center of the magnet. Hint: The dipole moment/mass for iron = 333 A · m 2 /kg.
836 Chapter 27. Introduction to MRI Coils and Magnets c) Assume you are placed in a large uniform magnetic field. Can you locate the direction of the field, if your only detection device is a paper clip? Describe how you might do this. 27.2.3 Shielding As described previously, the static fields produced by the main magnet can present safety risks when electronic devices or metallic objects are brought into the imaging environment. In order to minimize the region where these issues are important most main magnets are shielded to minimize fields produced outside of the imaging environment. Active Shielding Active shielding of fringe fields in MRI is gen erally accomplished by the addition of one coil pair at a larger radius than the interior pa irs. The current in the shielding (secondary) coil flows in the opposite direction to the interior coils, and so produces fields which tend to cancel the primary fields. The vector summation of the fields from the primary and shielding coils leads to a large reduction in the overall field outside of the magnet. Unfortunately shielding in this way also lead s to a significant reduction of the interior field. Therefore, to obtain a similar B 0 field, an actively shielded coil must have a significantly larger amount of primary and shielding current than is found in an unshielded magnet. Active shielding more than doubles the amount of t otal current needed to produce a similar B 0 in most cases. It appears that active shielding might be overly expensive since the magnet cost is strongly related to the amp-turns used to produce the field. However, this is not the case. Although active shielding does affect the initial magn et cost, since the magnets are superconducting it does not have a significant impact on subsequent operating costs. Also, active shielding simplifies magnet installation. By reducing the external fields, interactions with external magnetic materials are reduced. An actively shielded magnet can be brought to most sites and installed, with little concern for the build ing structure (iron beams, nearby traffic, etc.). Ferromagnetic or Passive Shielding Ferromagnetic shielding in MRI is based upon p rinciples similar to those used in electrical shielding. A magnet designer can make use of the boundary conditions, and properties of materials with large magnetic permeability μ to modify the form of fields local to the magnetic materials. Ferromagnetic shielding has been used in two primary ways in MRI. In the first case it has simply consisted of iron introduced into the walls of an imaging site where an unshielded magnet has been installed. The distortion of the main field due to the presence of the iron is then corrected on a case-by-case basis. Each new site presents new conditions for the people installing the magnet, and can lead to unique difficulties. Another way to address ferromagnetic shield ing is to include iron in the initial magnet design. The iron material surrounds the primary field producing coils in very close proximity,
27.2. The Main Magnet Coil 837 and its presence is included in the design of the homogeneous field. The effect is included by calculating the fields from the bare coils, and then calculating the contribution to the field from the iron in terms of moments. Advantages of this method are the same as those from active shielding. Disadvantages of this method are that the amount of iron necessary for shielding can lead to very heavy designs which are awkward to transport and install. Also, iron is difficult to treat mathematically, and leads to a large increase in the amount of computational power needed to achieve an initial design. 27.2.4 Shimming Shimming in magnet technology refers to the process of removing small inhomogeneities which are present in the field after the coil has been wound. It is not possible to consistently produce a set of coils whose homogeneity meets t he specifications imposed by the theoretical design. This is due to the large number of variables in the manufacturing process. Some of these variables include machine error in locating coil troughs, wire distribution during winding, contraction of the system when it is cooled to superconducting temperatures ( ≈ 4 K), shifting of the wires under magnetic (or passive) forces, presence of magnetic impurities in any of the surrounding structures, mechanical stresses during transport, and so forth. As a result when magnets are finally ‘brought to fie ld’ the homogeneity is typically found to be on the order of several hundred ppm. It is still necessary to achieve the original design homogeneity for imaging to take place, and a set of corrections must be applied to t he field before it is ready for imaging. The process of removing these final inhomogeneitie s from the magnet is referred to as shimming. There are two primary methods for shimming similar to those employed for shielding. Fer- romagnetic (or passive) shimming involves placing pieces of iron in the bore of the magnet close to the imaging region in order to eliminate moments in the field. Active shimming involves adding small amounts of extra current to a set of coils at a slightly larger radius than the primary coil, in order to add or subtract extra field as needed. Analysis of the field inhomogeneities and their corrections are all based upon moment analysis of the field as described in the first section of this chapter. Each piece of shimming iron, or shim coil is designed or positioned to generate specific mo ments which are used to cancel the unwanted moments present in the manufactured coil. In order to better understand the need for shims, and how they are employed, an example of a potential field distortion will be discussed. Consider the potential effects of N plastic rods which hold the superconducting coils in pl ace within their refrigerator. Due to their different thermal contraction properties it mi ght be expected that the azimuthal invariance of the coils will be distorted by these rods. In fact it is possible to predict the variation of the field as a function of φ they may cause. Their contribution to field distortion may vary as a linear combination of cos 2 πφ/N (each leg causes a distortion), in addition to a cos φ distribution of error due to the rods above the magnet being under more tension than the ones below due to gravity. Without any analysis, it is possible to predict that iron placed in the magnet to correct this distortion would have to be similarly distributed. The field profile is re-evaluated after corrections are added, and another set of shims is added if necessary. This process (measure/shim/evaluate) is repeated until the target field homogeneity for the magnet is achieved. Due to the complexity of the problem, field analysis
838 Chapter 27. Introduction to MRI Coils and Magnets is generally performed by a computer. The field is measured at a number of points, and the results are fed to the computer which decomposes the field into a sum of moments. The correct currents in shim coils or placement of iron to minimize individual moment contri- butions are then determined by the computer. A lthough, distortions can not be predicted in advance, the moment expansion of the fiel d may be used to correct field distortions in a systematic fashion. 27.3 Linearly Varying Field Gradients The second class of coils employed in MRI are linear magnetic field gradient coils. These coils are used to encode spatially the positions of the spins in MRI by varying the value of the local magnetic field causing spins’ Lar mor frequencies to vary as a function of their positions. These coils are rapidly switched during MRI sequences to allow the collection of large regions of k -space in a short amount of time. 27.3.1 Classic Designs There are several gradient coil designs based o n analytic solutions that were originally de- signed to correct field inhomogeneities in spectroscopic magnets. These designs, and simple modifications of them, are still employed in magnets today. Maxwell Pair ( z -Gradient) The z -gradient coil set is designed to produce a linear variation in the z -component of the field along the axis of the magnet, with a high degree of gradient uniformity in the transverse plane. Circular wire loops are again the most obvious choice since they are azimuthally symmetric and possess reasonable radial uniformity. As long as a symmetric gradient field is being considered, it is possible to describe the coils in terms of pairs, as was the case for main magnets. However, in the case of the gradient coil pairs their currents will be equal in magnit ude, but opposite in direction. Coils on one side of the z = 0 plane will generate fields parallel to B 0 while fields due to coils on the other side are anti-parallel to B 0 leading to an overall field variation along z . Linearity is achieved by choosing the relation between the radius of the coils and their axial locations in order to minimize all but the linear z term in (27.5). For a single coil pair, an analytic solution is available for which the z 3 term from both coils in (27.5) is zero, and the even z powers are all eliminated (see Fig. 27.10). This analysis closely parallels that already presented for the Helmholtz coil. It is found that if d = √ 3 a (27.10) (see Prob. 27.7) then the lowest order contam inant to the linear field is zero, and a reason- ably homogeneous field gradient can be obtain ed. A coil pair possessing these dimensions is referred to as a Maxwell pair or a Maxwell coil . Although the Maxwell pair provides reason- ably good homogeneity and performance many o f today’s imaging applications require more
27.3. Linearly Varying Field Gradients 839 Fig. 27.10: This figure represents a Maxwell coil pair. A set of wire loops coaxial with z are the most efficient choice for producing a z -gradient; however, with only two coils the linearity of the Maxwell pair is limited. homogeneity over greater distances than can be achieved with the fixed radius-to-length restrictions of this coil. Improvements to the Maxwell pair are generally achieved by introducing additional coil pairs. The z locations and currents for each coil pair can then be varied to eliminate higher- order moments. This can be accomplished by inspection or with the use of an inverse technique to determine the optimal coil locations and currents. Problem 27.7 Given a coil pair with radius a , z ′ = ± d/ 2, and equal and opposite currents given by I , a) Show that the even terms in (27.5) are all zero. b) Derive the Maxwell condition. In other words, find the relation between a and z ′ such that the z 3 term in (27.5) vanishes. c) Plot B z vs z for this coil pair for 2 cases. In the first case use the relation between a and d found in part (b). In the second case, change a or d by approximately 10% from this value. What is the effect on axial linearity? Golay Pair ( x -or y -Gradient) Producing a transverse gradient is somewhat more complicated than producing a z -gradient. If one is working on a cylindrical geometry, however, the x -and y -gradient coil sets are identical except for a rotation, owing to the azimuthal symmetry of the problem. One of the classic designs for a transverse gradient is the Golay pair as depicted in Fig. 27.11. The variation of B z along x is primarily due to the innermost azimuthal wires. The two inner wires on the upper coils produce fields parallel to B 0 , and the inner wires on the
840 Chapter 27. Introduction to MRI Coils and Magnets Fig. 27.11: A Golay pair. Notice that only the innermost turns are used to produce the desired field gradient. lower coil produce fields anti-parallel to B 0 . The combination of these fields leads to an overall variation of B z along the x -axis. If a symmetric gradient is desired along x then the coils can again be chosen with symmetric spatial design and anti-symmetric (with respect to x = 0) currents so that all of the even terms in an expansion of B z along x similar to (27.5) along z vanish. It is obvious that if the coils are to remain on the cylinder, their separation along the x -axis can not be varied, and therefore homogeneity must be optimized by varying the axial location of the azimuthally flowing wire paths. The optimal configuration of the Golay pair is shown in Fig. 27.11. Deriving the optimal configuration for the Golay pair is conceptually the same, but mathematically more difficult, than for the Maxwell and Helmholtz pair (see the paper s on coil design in the Suggested Reading). Unfortunately, the Golay pair is found to be a r elatively inefficient coil. This should be obvious since it can be seen that only the inne rmost azimuthal turn of each coil produces the desired variation of the field. Improvements to the Golay pair have been made by adding more coils with different axial locations and opening angles. These improvements were largely made by inspection. That is, coils were added, and then the system was re-evaluated and modified to eliminate as many higher-order moments from (27.5) as possible. 27.3.2 Calculating Linearly Varying Fields The Taylor series expansion of the magnetic field is especially useful for studying the gradients produced by a given coil. Analyzing the first derivative terms in Cartesian coordinates gives  x ·  ∇ B z (  x ) ∣ ∣ ∣  x =  0 = ( ∂B z ∂x ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣  x =  0 x + ( ∂B z ∂y ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣  y =  0 y + ( ∂B z ∂z ) ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣ ∣  z =  0 z
27.3. Linearly Varying Field Gradients 841 = G 0 x x + G 0 y y + G 0 z z (27.11) where only these linear terms have been considered in the previous chapters. It is obvious, however, that the other terms in (27.5) also contribute to the field, and that one of the primary goals in gradient coil design will be to minimize their contribution to the field in the imaging volume. From the expansion of the field and the Biot-Savart law it is possible to obtain analytic formulas for the gradient at any point due to an arbitrary current distribution.  G (  x )= μ 0 4 π  ∇ ∫ volume d 3 x ′ [ J x (  x ′ )( y − y ′ ) − J y (  x ′ )( x − x ′ ) |  x −  x ′ | 3 ] (27.12) In cases where the current is confined to a two-di mensional surface this expression can often be further reduced by using Maxwell’s equations to relate the different components of  J . In order to obtain the local gradient an alternative to the above formula is often used. This is due to the fact that a large number of programs are available to calculate B z ,and a simple numerical approximation to (27.12) can be obtained by considering the local field gradient to be the slope of B z between two points separated by some small distance, assuming B z varies linearly over this distance G x (  x ) ≈ B z ( x 2 ,y,z ) − B z ( x 1 ,y,z ) x 2 − x 1 G y (  x ) ≈ B z ( x, y 2 ,z ) − B z ( x, y 1 ,z ) y 2 − y 1 G z (  x ) ≈ B z ( x, y, z 2 ) − B z ( x, y, z 1 ) z 2 − z 1 (27.13) This method of calculation is less efficient, because the field must be calculated at two points, and less accurate. It is often used because a field plot can be generated simultaneously, despite the need to calculate a large number of points in order to get accurate values of the local gradients. 27.3.3 Desirable Properties of Linear Gradient Coils Gradient coils must satisfy a unique set of performance criteria. Also, much more than main magnets, gradient coils can be designe d with a specific imaging application and per- formance criterion in mind. Some performance cri teria universally desirable in gradient coils include: low inductance, high gradient to curre nt ratio, minimal resistance, good gradient uniformity, minimal interaction with conducting shields, absence of torque, high duty cycle, minimum ∂B/∂t novel geometries). Inductance, Efficiency, and Resistance For most imaging applications gradient coils are turned on and off as rapidly as possible, but the waveform they follow is not sinusoidal excep t in specialized EPI applications. Therefore, , and comfortable patient access (often requires development of coils with
842 Chapter 27. Introduction to MRI Coils and Magnets for the most part resonant circuit theory can not be applied. Instead the only way to attain the rapid switching desired is to minimize the inductance of the coils, or increase the voltage of the amplifiers being used as is illustrated by the basic electromagnetic relationship 3 emf applied = L total ∂I ∂t (27.14) Since the voltages which may be safely used in combination with high currents are limited, optimization of rise times (time it takes the gradient to achieve its maximum value) is assumed to be a problem of minimizing the inductance of the gradient system without degrading the quality of the field. The desirable properties of minimum inducta nce, high gradient to current ratio, and low resistance are closely related. It is possible to see how achieving any one of these goals is likely to satisfy all three. Consider the electro magnetic energy associated with the gradient coil E = 1 2 L tot I 2 = 1 2 [ L self + L mutual ] I 2 (27.15) = 1 2 μ 0 ∫ volume d 3 x ∣ ∣ ∣  B ∣ ∣ ∣ 2 (27.16) where L self represents the self inductance of the wires in the gradient coils and L mutual represents the inductance between different wires in the coil set. L self is proportional to the amount of wire used in the coil which is also proportional to the amount of resistance in the system ( R = ρ/A wire ). Therefore by minimizing L tot , resistance is also reduced. The resistance of the coils is directly related to the power deposited in the coils, and the amount of heat generated. Heating of the coils is a primary limit on duty cycle. 4 It can be seen that L tot is also related to the total amount of field produced by the coils. Any fields produced outside of the imaging region reduce the efficiency of the coil, because they require energy for their support, but are not used in the experiments. Reducing L tot while maintaining the desired gradient quality reduces these extraneous fields by decreasing ∫ volume d 3 x ∣ ∣ ∣  B ∣ ∣ ∣ 2 . 27.3.4 Eddy Currents and dB/dt The rapid switching of the gradients leads to rapidly changing amounts of flux through the rf coils, rf shields, main magnet components, and the person being imaged. This changing 3 The full expression for emf applied is emf applied = L total ∂I/∂t + I ·R , but when emf applied /I R 1this term may be neglected. This is generally the case when the gradient coils in MRI are being turned on and off. 4 Duty cycle is the ratio between amount of time a gradient coil (or any other device) can be on versus the time it must be off. For example, a duty cycle of 50% implies that a gradient may be generating fields half of the time and must be dormant for half of the time. For gradient coils duty cycle often changes with the level of gradient the coil is asked to produce, i.e., a gradient coil with a 50% duty cycle when G max is being generated by the coil may have a duty cycle of 100% when it is only used to produce G max / 2.
