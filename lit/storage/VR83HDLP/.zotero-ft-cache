Motion-Insensitive Rapid Configuration Relaxometry

Damien Nguyen1,2* and Oliver Bieri1,2

Purpose: Triple echo steady state (TESS) uses the lowest steady state configuration modes for rapid relaxometry. Due to its unbalanced gradient scheme, however, TESS is inherently motion-sensitive. The purpose of this work is to merge TESS with a balanced acquisition scheme for motion-insensitive rapid configuration relaxometry, termed MIRACLE. Methods: The lowest order steady state free precession (SSFP) configurations are retrieved by Fourier transformation of the frequency response of N frequency-shifted balanced SSFP (bSSFP) scans and subsequently processed for relaxometry, as proposed with TESS. Accuracy of MIRACLE is evaluated from simulations, phantom studies as well as in vivo brain and cartilage imaging at 3T. Results: Simulations and phantom results revealed no conceptual flaw, and artifact-free configuration imaging was achieved in vivo. Overall, relaxometry results were accurate in phantoms and in good agreement for cartilage and for T2 in the brain, but apparent low T1 values were observed for brain white matter; reflecting asymmetries in the bSSFP profile. Conclusion: Rapid T1 and T2 mapping with MIRACLE offers analogous properties as TESS while successfully mitigating its motionsensitivity. As a result of the Fourier transformation, relaxometry becomes sensitive to the voxel frequency distribution, which may contain useful physiologic information, such as structural brain integrity.

this context, SSFP-based imaging techniques (1) have shown compelling results thanks to their short scan times and high signal-to-noise ratios, e.g., for relaxation time mapping (2–8), for measuring molecular proton diffusion (9–13), for the assessment of magnetization transfer effects (14–16), or for the characterization of flow or motion (17–19).
Generally, relaxation occupies a central role within the context of NMR: it not only defines contrast in conventional MRI but also reflects the interaction of water on a molecular level. Historically, longitudinal relaxation (T1) has been estimated by sampling the inversion-recovery curve of the longitudinal magnetization using spin-echo sequences, while the transverse relaxation (T2) time has been estimated from the decay curve of the transverse magnetization using single-echo or, more frequently, multiecho spin-echo (SE) methods. Quantification based on the functional dependencies of the steady state, however, is much faster. One common attribute of SSFP methods is their mixed T2=T1 imaging contrast (20); being a natural consequence of a pulse repetition time (TR) that is much shorter than T2. Consequently, accurate quantification of relaxation times using SSFP-based imaging techniques is usually hampered by a T2-related bias in T1 estimates for radio-frequency (RF) spoiled SSFP (21,22), or by a T1related bias in T2, as observed with balanced SSFP (bSSFP) (23), partially spoiled SSFP (8), and double echo

methods are sensitive to transmit field (B1) inhomogeneities, whereas some of them show, in addition, some sensi-

Quantification is thought to represent an important step toward significant improvements of the diagnostic potential of MRI, such as for the early detection of subtle or diffuse pathological changes with high specificity and sensitivity, for an unbiased assessment of treatment or drug effects, as well as for clinical trials in drug research across different sites and machines. Quantitative imaging, however, is rather time consuming and typically becomes an issue in the clinical environment, where the overall success and applicability of quantitative MRI strongly depends on the overall acquisition speed.

interference of T1 and T2 of coherent SSFP methods by using a triple echo steady state (TESS) imaging approach. To this end, TESS acquires the three lowest SSFP configuration modes within a single acquisition (or TR) yielding two independent ratios for simultaneous rapid quantification of both T1 and T2 using a golden section search. Quite remarkably, TESS achieves an almost completely B1-unbiased estimation of T2, and showed good prospects for rapid threedimensional (3D) T2 mapping of articular cartilage imaging in the clinical setting (26). Generally, TESS is also insensitive to B0 inhomogeneities but the nonbalanced gradient scheme introduces some motion sensitivity that can be softened with

In this work, we aim to replace the unbalanced gradient scheme of TESS by a balanced one leading to “motioninsensitive rapid configuration relaxometry”, termed MIRACLE (29), that indirectly retrieves the basic SSFP modes from a series of bSSFP scans.

As shown previously in a seminal work by Zur et al (31), it is possible to retrieve the basic SSFP configurations or modes Fn (see Eq. [4]) from a discrete Fourier transformation of the complex bSSFP frequency response. To this end, we proceed as follows:

in an iterative approach relying on the fact that both ratios show different dependencies on T1 and T2 as was shown in Heule et al (25). From Equation [10] and in the limit where the amplitudes of higher-order Fn modes are negligible (i.e., for large enough N), only the phase of the SSFP modes depends on the local off-resonance F. As a result, the signal ratios used for estimation of T1 (cf. Eq. [12]) and T2 (cf. Eq. [13]) are off-resonance insensitive. A global initial estimate of T1 ¼ 1000 ms was used for all simulations and experiments and a tolerance of 0.1 ms was assumed as convergence criteria for the iterative search. Similarly to TESS relaxometry, we expect T1 estimates to have some remaining B1-bias, while T2 is anticipated to be largely free of any B1 bias.

ringing was removed from base data as recently proposed by Kellner et al (33).
Simulations of the bSSFP signal were performed for a T1=T2-ratio $ 12 using sets of 4 to 12 scans with a TR/ echo time (TE) of 5.76/2.88 ms and RF phase increments w, as given by Equation [5]. Evaluation of the accuracy of the proposed method for a range of T1 and T2 with an eight-point sampling scheme was performed using the same set of parameters. The influence of the flip angle on the estimation of the relaxation parameters was evaluated by performing a Monte-Carlo simulation with 100,000 independent runs for a N ¼ 8 phase cycling scheme with flip angles between 1  and 60  and the addition of 1% Gaussian white noise to simulate experimental conditions. For each flip angle, the coefficient of variation (CV) for both relaxation parameters was calculated (defined as the ratio of the standard deviation and the mean over all runs; CVðTiÞ :¼ DTi=Ti ; i ¼ 1; 2).
Phantom experiments were performed on a manganesedoped spherical phantom composed of 0.125 mM MnCl2

dissolved in water (with nominal T1/T2 values of 860/70 ms (25) and approximately 14 cm in diameter using an eight-point 3D MIRACLE scheme with the following protocol parameters: TR/TE ¼ 5.10/2.55 ms, a ¼ 15 , a resolution of 1 Â 1 Â 2 mm3 (image matrix: 208 Â 162 Â 80), a bandwidth of 401 Hz/px, elliptical scanning and RF phase increments w as given by Equation [5]. With this setup, an overall scan time of approximately 7 min was obtained. The 3D TESS relaxometry was realized using the same parameters, except for TR/TE 6.19/3.17 ms, 2 averages and a bandwidth of 800 Hz/px for a total scan time of 8 min. Reference T1 relaxometry was realized using a single-slice inversion-recovery turbo spin-echo (IR-TSE) sequence with a TR/TE of 5000/13 ms, and inversion times (TI) of 50, 100, 200, 400, 800, 1600, 3200 ms. Estimation of T1 was obtained from a nonlinear fit of the recovery curve (34). Further scanning parameters include turbo factor (TF) 7, a ¼ 180 , an in-plane resolution of 1 mm2 (image matrix: 208 Â 168), slice thickness 2 mm, a bandwidth of 130 Hz/ px, GRAPPA 2 with 34 reference lines for a scan time of 1:17 min (8:59 min total). Furthermore, reference T2 relaxometry was performed using single echo spin-echo (SE) sequence with a TR of 1500 ms, and a TE of 10, 20, 40, 80, 150, 250 ms, a ¼ 180 , an in-plane resolution of 1 mm2 (image matrix: 208 Â 168), slice thickness 2 mm, a bandwidth of 201 Hz/px, GRAPPA 2 with 34 reference lines resulting in 1:30 min/acquisition (9:00 min total). T2 mapping was performed using a maximum likelihood estimator approach, as described by Golub et al (35).

image of each MIRACLE dataset was accomplished before B1 correction using routines from the FSL libraries (37,38) for brain images or by using the elastix registration program (39,40) in other cases.
RESULTS
A noise-free simulation of the complex bSSFP frequency response (cf. Eqs. [1,2]) is presented in Figure 1a for a tissue mimicking a T1=T2-ratio of approximately 12 for a N ¼ 8 point phase cycling scheme and in the limit of a continuous RF phase increment. The corresponding Fourier transforms (cf. Eq. [9]) are shown in Figure 1b. Aliasing in the case of a finite N becomes evident and generally leads to a systematic deviation between the true mode amplitudes and the ones using N-point Fourier transform; especially for higher configuration orders (p) (see Figure 1b). As expected, increasing the number N of RF phases wi improves the overall accuracy of the mode amplitude estimates (cf. Figure 1c), and do not exceed 1.2% for the lowest order modes (p ¼ À1; 0; 1) for N ! 8. The resulting T1 and T2 estimation error follows a similar trend (cf. Figure 1d), and is in the absence of noise below 0.01% for a T1=T2 $ 12 in combination with phase cycling acquisition schemes using N ! 8.
Analysis of the estimation error eðTiÞ :¼ jTi MIRACLE ÀTi j, as a function of T1 and T2, is presented in Figure 2 for a fixed N ¼ 8 MIRACLE acquisition scheme. The overall error is in general much larger for T2 than for T1, indicating the need to acquire more than 8 phase-cycles for T2 values exceeding roughly 100 ms.
Generally, the decay of the modes (FpÞ with increasing mode order jpj, e.g., as observed in Figure 1b, not only depends on the relaxation, but also on the flip angle a (cf. Eqs. [2,12] in Ganter) (41). As a result, different flip angle settings might be required for MIRACLE as compared to TESS. In line with the flip angle optimization results for TESS, however, Monte-Carlo simulations also revealed for MIRACLE a clear optimum for flip angles around 15  (see Figure 3). Consequently, this flip angle

was used for all subsequent acquisitions. Moreover, in complete analogy to TESS imaging, the estimation of T2 is found to be largely insensitive to B1, whereas the T1 estimates retain the usual B1 dependency. The bias in both T1 and T2, as introduced by flip angle miscalibrations is shown in Figure 4. For a fixed T1, the error in T1 scales approximately linearly with relative B1 values ranging from 0.5 to 1.5, whereas the bias in T2 from B1 (for fixed T1 values) is less than 0.1 ms over the whole investigated B1-range.
Motion-insensitive SSFP mode imaging and subsequent relaxometry is now exemplarily illustrated in Figure 5 at 3T for a manganese-doped spherical probe. Figure 5a depicts the original N ¼ 8 phase-cycled bSSFP images, Figure 5b shows the resulting mode images for F0, F1; and FÀ1, and Figures 5c,d present the estimated T1 and T2 maps from 3D MIRACLE, 3D TESS, IR-TSE, and SE measurements. Both MIRACLE-T2 and TESS-T2 exhibit no spatial variations across the whole imaging volume. MIRACLE-T1 and TESS-T1 estimates have already been corrected for B1 inhomogeneities by using the separately acquired B1 map, which results in flat T1 profiles over the whole field-of-view. Overall, very good agreement is found between all three methods for both T1 and T2. Evaluation of relaxation parameters within the indicated region-of-interest (ROI) are collected in Table 1 for all three methods.
High resolution in vivo 3D brain T1 and T2 mapping with MIRACLE and reference measurements is demonstrated in Figure 6 at 3T in axial slice orientation. In contrast to 3D TESS, no pulsation artifacts are noticeable in the derived base mode images (Fig. 6a and Supporting Fig. S1, which is available online, for 3D TESS brain images) and, as a result, successful T1 and T2 mapping is demonstrated in 3D (Figs. 6b,c) using motion-insensitive SSFP (31). For comparison, reference IR-TSE and SE results are also presented for the same slice. Evaluation of relaxation parameters inside highlighted ROIs can be found inside Table 1.

FIG. 8. Exemplary bSSFP frequency response for gray (a) and white (b) brain matter (for the definition of ROIs, see Figure 6), as well as, for patellar cartilage (c) and muscle tissues (d) (for the definition of ROIs, see Figure 7). Note the increased asymmetry in the case of white versus gray brain matter.

Finally, 3D MIRACLE imaging is demonstrated in the knee joint (Fig. 7) at 3T in axial slice orientation. See Table 1 for the evaluation of T1 and T2 within marked ROIs. Zonal variation in patellar cartilage T1 and T2 is clearly visible with a decrease in both T1 and T2 values from superficial to deep layers, as typically expected and observed for healthy cartilage (see insets, Figure 7).
DISCUSSION
Indirect estimation of the lowest order SSFP modes for rapid T1 and T2 mapping from a set of phase-cycled bSSFP scans using a Fourier transformation yields similar properties as TESS relaxometry. Furthermore, due to the balanced gradients used in the present case, MIRACLE relaxometry is expected to be less sensitive to diffusive effects than TESS, particularly in fluids (27). Still, it is important to remember that the accuracy of the presented method relies on the ability to correctly retrieve the SSFP mode amplitudes FÀ1, F0, and F1 from the bSSFP profile. This not only depends on the number N of RF phase increments used, but also on how fast the configurations decay with increasing order jpj (e.g., see Figure 1b). For TR ( T1;2, the decay of the mode amplitudes becomes a function of the flip angle a and the relaxation time ratio T1=T2 (41). As a result, aliasing becomes more and more an issue with decreasing T1=T2, e.g., as observed in Figure 4, where the error in T2 increases with increasing T2 (for a constant T1). Consequently, accurate relaxometry of fluids might not be granted, even for N ¼ 12. Nonetheless, the phantom data show that MIRACLE is in very good agreement with both 3D TESS and reference IR-TSE and SE methods for tissue-like T1=T2 ratios. In addition to the aforementioned effects, patient movements between phase-cycles may affect the success of MIRACLE relaxometry, although adequate fixation and image registration could be used to mitigate such effects.

Typical T1-values reported in the literature for white and gray brain matter are approximately 950–1000 ms (42) and 1300–1500 ms (43,44), respectively, which are similar to what was obtained during our reference measurements. Interestingly, and in contrast to the simulations as well as phantom and cartilage experiments, in vivo brain imaging with MIRACLE demonstrates a systematic underestimation of T1 even after B1 correction. This bias is likely linked to the asymmetric shape of the bSSFP frequency response, as exemplified in Figure 8 for brain tissue, but more prominently for white as compared to gray matter. Those asymmetries have already been discussed in some details by Miller et al (45,46) and are believed to be due to an inhomogeneous intra-voxel frequency content. This is not unexpected as brain tissues contain microstructural boundaries, compartments or chemical shifts that might not be properly characterized by a single pair of relaxation parameters and thus by a single-compartment signal behavior as assumed by Equations [1,2]. To further investigate these effects, noise-free simulations of the bSSFP signal in the case of a two-components model assuming Lorentzian line shapes were performed. As was initially proposed by Miller et al (46), we assume identical T1 and T2 (830/80 ms) for both components, a fixed line width of G1 ¼ 0.1 Hz for the first component, and a volume fraction of 0.15 for the second component. Corresponding MIRACLET1 and -T2 values as a function of the second component’s width (G2) and frequency shift (Df ) are shown in Figure 9a. Because this results in an overestimation rather than an underestimation of T1, this model fails to describe the observed MIRACLE brain data.
Generally, the constraint of having the same relaxation properties for both components might be too restrictive. Deoni et al (47) suggested a two-component system with a volume fraction of roughly 0.28 for white matter, where the dominating component has a rather low T1=T2-ratio of 900/120 ms, in contrast to a rather high T1/T2-ratio of

Motion-Insensitive Rapid Configuration Relaxometry

525

In summary, T1 and T2 mapping with MIRACLE offers analogous properties as TESS while successfully mitigating its motion-sensitivity. In contrast to the literature, however, apparent low T1 values are observed for brain white matter; reflecting the asymmetry in the bSSFP signal profile. As a result, a configuration-based relaxometry, as suggested with MIRACLE, becomes sensitive to changes in the underlying frequency spectrum and content, and might, therefore, offer improved sensitivity to diffuse pathophysiological changes in the brain. Future work will aim to explore this new frequency-sensitive relaxometry method.

CONCLUSIONS
A rapid motion-insensitive configuration-based steady state relaxometry method was presented. Compared with most SSFP methods, it offers accurate and robust T2 quantification of human tissues, even in the presence of substantial B0 and B1 field inhomogeneities, as demonstrated in the scope of this work. In contrast to contemporary single component relaxometry methods, however, our results and preliminary modelling indicate that MIRACLE becomes sensitive to the T1 and T2 intra-voxel frequency dispersion.

FIG. 9. Estimated MIRACLE T1 and T2 from a simulated twocomponent system with identical T1=T2 values of 830/80 ms and a volume fraction of 0.15 (a), and T1=T2 values of 900/120 ms and 380/ 10 ms (b), respectively, as well as a volume fraction of 0.28. The inset in (a) depicts the parameter space investigated: the first component is assumed to be on-resonant with a width G1 ¼ 0.1 Hz, whereas the values for the width G2 and frequency shift Df of the second component are varied as shown above. Typical values reported by Miller et al (46) for white matter are Df ¼ 17–23 Hz and G2 ¼ 19–22 Hz (depending on the orientation).
380/10 ms for the smaller component, reflecting myelin. Note that contrary to the aforementioned study, we do not consider exchanges between species in the present case. We now repeat the analysis done previously and show the corresponding MIRACLE results in Figure 9b. Within this framework, we observe a shift to apparent low T1 values in combination with typical T2 values that are in good agreement with the MIRACLE-T1 and -T2 values from our experiments. Consequently, the low T1 values observed in vivo are likely to originate from the presence of a myelin-like second component with different frequency distribution, in line with the observation that the resulting bias in T1 is much less pronounced for gray matter, where lower myelin contents are expected. The aforementioned suspected sensitivity of MIRACLE to tissue heterogeneity and frequency asymmetry is further corroborated by the results observed for articular cartilage. Here, the observed T1 and T2 values are in very good agreement to previously published values (25,48), which is expected because cartilage is known to be much less heterogeneous (49).
