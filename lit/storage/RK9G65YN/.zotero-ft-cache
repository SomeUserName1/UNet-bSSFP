Abstract

Diffusion-weighted imaging, dependent on motion of water molecules, provides information regarding tissue integrity. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values in the normal brain parenchyma, and those in a variety of lesions were studied by echo-planar diffusion MRI in 310 cases. Brain disorders were classified based on their ADC values, taking the ADC values of the normal brain white matter as the principal category. In the normal white matter ADC ranges were 0.60–1.05×10 −3  mm 2 /s, and the mean ADC value was 0.84±0.11×10 −3  mm 2 /s. It was possible to distribute brain disorders, as well as artefacts on diffusion MRI to five major categories: category 1, ADC similar to normal white matter; category 2, ADC lower than normal white matter; category 3, ADC higher than normal white matter; category 4, ADC similar to CSF; and category 5, markedly low or high ADC. Further studies can provide addition of different lesions as well as refinements of these categories.
Introduction

Diffusion-weighted MR imaging is a relatively new sequence reflecting molecular motion of water within the tissue, so providing data on tissue integrity. In conventional MR imaging, diffusion of water molecules in the tissues has an extremely small contribution to the MR signal. In diffusion MRI, powerful magnetic gradients with echo planar sequence are used. This enables images that are dependent on water diffusion. A diffusion coefficient called apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value can be calculated, and ADC maps can be generated. Diffusion MRI has mainly been used for detection of acute ischemia (cytotoxic edema), and for distinction of cytotoxic and vasogenic edema [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9], [10], and its role in other brain diseases such as neurodegenerative and metabolic conditions, infections, tumors, and others has been investigated [11], [12], [13], [14], [15]. This article is a preliminary report from our prospective study on diffusion MRI in an attempt to establish normal ADC values in the brain, and in a variety of disorders.

Subjects and methods

In this study, 310 cases (166 males, 144 females) are included covering 52 normal individuals, and 258 patients with brain lesions, out of our ongoing studies on diffusion MRI since 1998. There were 26 infants (age range: 1 day–2 years; mean 8 months), 74 children (2–18 years; mean 6.3 years), and 210 adults (18–81 years; mean 47.8 years). Conventional MR imaging and echo planar diffusion weighted imaging were performed on a 1.5 T MR unit (Magnetom Vision, Siemens, Erlangen, Germany).

Diffusion MRI was
ADC values in the normal brain

The mean ADC values (×10 −3  mm 2 /s) in the normal brain belonging to the first group, covering infants up to 2 years of age were as follows: unmyelinated white matter, 1.64±0.17; myelinated white matter, 0.90±0.12; paracentral cortices, 0.83±0.14; basal ganglia, thalami, 0.98±0.11; brainstem, 1.00±0.10; and cerebellar parenchyma, 0.97±0.13.

The mean ADC values in the normal brain belonging to the second group, covering children and adults from 2 to 81 years of age were as follows: white matter,
Discussion

Random motion of water molecules is referred to as Brownian motion or ‘translational molecular diffusion’, and it is relatively free in homogeneous fluid-containing structures. This type of water diffusion is called isotropic diffusion. On the other hand, in the tissues (e.g. brain parenchyma), water motion is restricted by the presence of cellular structures which provide barriers to free diffusion. This restriction may be more in one direction than in another (e.g. around axons). This type of
Summary

Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values are studied in the normal brain parenchyma, and in a variety of brain lesions. Echo-planar diffusion-weighted imaging, using either a three-axis or trace approach, were performed on a 1.5 T MR unit (Magnetom Vision) in 310 patients, ages ranging from 1 day to 81 years. ADC calculations were performed either from automated ADC maps or from the Stejskal–Tanner formula.

ADC values (×10 −3  mm 2 /s) in normals were: unmyelinated white matter, 1.64±0.17: myelinaetd
