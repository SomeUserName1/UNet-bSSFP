Summary

This chapter introduces the basic electromagnetic and mathematical concepts needed to understand the design of the coils that generate the fields used in MRI. It discusses the desirable properties of the various coil systems (main magnet, rf, and gradient). The design of coils lies primarily in determining the optimal arrangements of current necessary to produce the magnetic fields used in MRI. The second class of coils employed in MRI are linear magnetic field gradient coils. These coils are used to encode spatially the positions of the spins in MRI by varying the value of the local magnetic field causing spins Larmor frequencies to vary as a function of their positions. These coils are rapidly switched during MRI sequences to allow the collection of large regions of κ-space in a short amount of time. It gives a brief introduction to radiofrequency power deposition and specific absorption rate.
