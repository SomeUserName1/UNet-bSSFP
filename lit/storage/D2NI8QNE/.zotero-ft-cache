Abstract
Purpose

Standard relaxation time quantification using phase-cycled balanced steady-state free precession (bSSFP), eg, motion-insensitive rapid configuration relaxometry (MIRACLE), is subject to a considerable underestimation of tissue T 1 and T 2 due to asymmetric intra-voxel frequency distributions. In this work, an artificial neural network (ANN) fitting approach is proposed to simultaneously extract accurate reference relaxation times (T 1 , T 2 ) and robust field map estimates ( urn:x-wiley:07403194:media:mrm28325:mrm28325-math-0001 , ΔB 0 ) from the bSSFP profile.
Methods

Whole-brain bSSFP data acquired at 3T were used for the training of a feedforward ANN with N = 12, 6, and 4 phase-cycles. The magnitude and phase of the Fourier transformed complex bSSFP frequency response served as input and the multi-parametric reference set [T 1 , T 2 , urn:x-wiley:07403194:media:mrm28325:mrm28325-math-0002 , ∆B 0 ] as target. The ANN predicted relaxation times were validated against the target and MIRACLE.
Results

The ANN prediction of T 1 and T 2 for trained and untrained data agreed well with the reference, even for only four acquired phase-cycles. In contrast, relaxometry based on 4-point MIRACLE was prone to severe off-resonance-related artifacts. ANN predicted urn:x-wiley:07403194:media:mrm28325:mrm28325-math-0003 and ∆B 0 maps showed the expected spatial inhomogeneity patterns in high agreement with the reference measurements for 12-point, 6-point, and 4-point bSSFP phase-cycling schemes.
Conclusion

ANNs show promise to provide accurate brain tissue T 1 and T 2 values as well as reliable field map estimates. Moreover, the bSSFP acquisition can be accelerated by reducing the number of phase-cycles while still delivering robust T 1 , T 2 , urn:x-wiley:07403194:media:mrm28325:mrm28325-math-0004 , and ∆B 0 estimates.
